14                                                                                                                                                                                                          I've even used it in the  pedestrian  mode, and it's amazing how accurate it is .

21                                                                                                                                                                                                            0 out of 5 stars GPS Navigator doesn't navigate accurately on a straight road .
22                                                                                                                                                                                          I was familiar with the streets and only used the Nuvi to get an accurate arrival time estimate .
23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 but after that it is very easy and quite accurate to use .

25                                                                                                                                              While the 255W routing seems generally accurate and logical, on my first use I discovered that it does have some errors in its internal map .
26                                                                                                                                                                                                    Bottom line is I wanted a unit that is accurate and had reliable satellite connection .
27                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I've used it around town and find it to be extremely accurate .
28                                                                                                                                                                          I found the maps to be inaccurate at first, but after I updated them from Garmin's website everything is golden .
29                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 A lot of my friends' addresses are inaccurate by any GPS .
30                                                                                                                                                                                        It loads quickly, have pretty accurate directions, and can recalculate quickly when I miss a turn .
31                                                                                                                            Because the accuracy is good to the street address level, it may not be able to guide you to the exact location if your destination is inside a shopping mall .
32                                                                                                                                                                                            I updated to the latest 2010 map soon after I received the unit, so the map is accurate to me .
33                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I was blown away at the accuracy and routing capability this thing had .

38                                                                I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .

49                                                        I'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .

32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The bathroom was large and included a mounted makeup mirror .
33                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The rooms are abit smallish  , but immaculately maintained, and tastefully decorated, with excellent bathroom facilities .
34                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Shower bathroom was good with good shower and plenty of space .
35                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Both the bedroom and bathroom had plenty of room .
36                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           large clean bathrooms fully stocked with everything needed .
37                                                                                                                                                                                                  However, when we arrived at our room there was a maintenance worker there measuring the bathroom counter, so maybe they're doing work in some units .
38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The room was large and very comfortable with a nice large bathroom .
39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  There is a wall, mounted hair dryer in the bathroom .
40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The thing that bothered me the most was the bathroom was very dated .
41                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            There is virtually no counterspace in the bathroom at all .
42                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Upon our arrival, there was a SLIGHT odor in bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .
43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The bathroom was adequate with thick, fluffy towels .
44                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The bathroom was large and private .
45                                                                                                                                                                                                              The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .
46                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .
47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .
48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .
49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .
50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .
51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The room was a good size but the bathroomm was very small .
52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Bathroom was adequate and clean and there was a hairdryer .
53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The wash basin was in the room without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .
54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The bathroom had not been remodeled in alignment, but it was all very clean and perfectly acceptable .
55                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom had several problems .
56                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Bathrooms were also very nice .

60                                                                                                                                                                                               We may have had an ADA room because it was pretty big with large bathroom ,  it was room 459 ,  and the room had all the amenities we were looking for .
61                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The room   and bathroom were perfect in size,  just what is needed .
62                                                                                                                                                                                                         The only possible complaint was that the sink in the bathroom had a crack in it, but it did not bother me enough to ask for a different room .
63                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Bathrooms, though, are plenty big .
64                                                                                                                                                          Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .
65                                                                                                                                                                                                        It represents value for money, the rooms and bathrooms were impeccably clean, fresh linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .
66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    There were plenty of thick towels in the bathroom, and all the usual toiletries, hair, dryer, etc .
67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I really didn't get a chance to experience the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .
68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom was also small  it was difficult to close the door once inside to avoid the door hitting you no joke !
69                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Some rooms had the bathroom sink outside the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .
70                                                                                                                                                                             The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .
71                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The rooms were very nice, could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .
72                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The bathroom was clean but a little dated .
73                                                                                                                                                                                                        The only thing wrong with the room was the bathroom, it was not up to the standard of the rest of the decor but it was clean and large enough .
74                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The bathroom was just okay, but for the price we survived .
75                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Hair dryer in bathroom constantly fell in sink from it's holder when anyone used the door to our room .
76                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The reasonable price of the hotel allowed us to book 2 rooms, thus giving the 4 of us a bit more space and 2 bathrooms   .
77                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Plenty of room in the bathroom .
78                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Nice clean rooms and a spaciousbathroom .
79                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The only minor downside, as a few others have mentioned, is the bathroom sink lighting .
80                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Did not like the bathroom light shining into bedroom   .
81                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Only negative is the bathroom area is a little small .
82                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Our suite we had was small there was pubic hair on the bathroom floor from  ?
83                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  bathroom a little on the older side .
84                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The bathroom needed a face, lift also .

10   Before purchasing, I was obsessed with the reviews and predictions I found online and reading about some of the critiques such as the thick border, the lack of touchscreen, lack of battery SD slot, lack of a back light, awkward difficult keyboard layout, minimally faster page flipping, and the super, high price .

22                                                                                                                                                                                           When that came in, it was also in the critical battery stage and this time the charge light would not even come on upon charging .
23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Battery life is very good, even with the wireless on constantly .

25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Many have been critical of the non user replaceability of the battery .

27                                                                                                                                                                More likely, by the time the battery no longer holds a charge, there will be a K7 with a color screen and 200 times the memory that I'll want to upgrade to !
28                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,  Battery life is weeks at a time, even with constant use .
29                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And the battery life has gotten a lot shorter too, again, after TONS of use .
30                                                                                                                                                                                                                    which, I guess, is unavoidable with rechargable batteries, but I wish I could change the battery myself .

42                                                                                                                                                                              It's not clear how big an advantage it is to have the extra battery life, though, because both get you through a long day with power to spare .
43                                                                                                                                                                                                                            the screen is small, and the battery doesn't last long enough to be used in the way I use books .

47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     So far, the battery charge seems to last quite a long time for reading .
48                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I leave the wireless access feature turned off for longer battery life .
49                                                                                                                                                                                           So far, it has taken anywhere from two to three hours to recharge the device, depending on how far down I've let the battery run .
50                                                                                                                                                                         I'm not pleased with the prospect of having to send the unit in to have the battery replaced when it finally fails and won't take or hold a charge .
51                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Apparently the Kindle 1 had a battery the owner could replace quickly, the way a cell phone does .
52                                                                                                                                                                                                                        So I give the Kindle 2 an A, minus, the minus because the battery isn't replaceable by the end user .
53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               So my only real complaint right now is a battery the end, user can't replace .
54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             And the lack of backlight saves on the battery .

69                                                                                                                                                    Oh and one more thing ,  I've discovered that if you turn of  wifi    until you know you need to send or retrieve something, the battery lasts for many many more hours .
70                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             A clip, on light seems like a fine solution, plus it doesn't drain the battery .
71                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,  The battery life seems fine to me .
72                                                         I left wireless on for the first 3 days, and after reading through  Ur  and 25% of  DaVinci Code , plus lots of general playing around with the device and checking out features, I got the low, battery warning about 55 hours after intially charging it to full .
73                                                                                                                                                                                                                          This feature uses a lot of battery and the battery lasts for maximum 2, 3 days but it is worth it .
74                                                                                                                                                                                      I live in the UK, my Kindle arrived last Thursday and it was up and running in minutes as the battery had some charge when it arrived .
75                                                                                                                                                                   The Kindle does not come with a UK power adaptor, so that has been an extra £12 expense, but I could charge the battery using the computer and USB cable .
76                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The battery life is unbelievable too .

78                                                                                                                                          The books download quickly, the battery lasts a long time, it is simple to use, the bookmark feature is nice, and I love the cool pics on the screen when you turn the gadget off .
79                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The battery life is great and I even like the screen savers .

82                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I've left the wireless on and really don't see tremendous battery usage yet .

32                                                    One thing I noticed that was not so good was the battery life, but I've only charged it once and that was on the computer  as far as I've seen my computer doen't charge well with either of my iPods so the battery life is possibly greater than I thought if using a wall outlet .
33                                                                                                                                                                                                                           the battery life  this was an awsome christmas present and i love it its really easy to use and sounds great .

17                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 For $30, $40 more you get one less usb port, you get covered usb ports which is annoying, and you get less than half the battery life .
18                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       It has the longest battery life of any notebook .
19                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 While my 1005HA works like a charm, I personally know several folks that have experienced issues with the battery and or power supply .
20                                                                                                                                                                   Eventually, I noticed that most of these critical reviews referred to the battery or to the charging brick and most of those were describing what could have easily been mistakes made by the owners of the machine .
21                                                                                                                                                                                                                  They didn't attach the power cord properly or the charging time was too short and some didn't seem to understand how to determine when the battery was fully charged .
22                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Some complainers faulted the battery life, but didn't take into account what was running or turned on when using the computer .
23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The battery is drained more quickly when the computer is operating with all rockets running .
24                                                                                                                                   I suppose that is one reason why I kept gravitating to the ASUS Eee PC 1005HA, PU1X, BU as I explored the reviews for other brands, , in spite of the warnings about unworkable battery chargers and inoperative batteries I bought the Asus Eee PC .
25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The main difference is probably the ten hour battery that is unique and ships with the ASUS Eee PC 1005HA, PU1X, BU .
26                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I wanted the netbook to use on long airplane flights so the long life battery was a real plus for me .
27                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The Asus Eee PC is sleek and that big battery doesn't stick out on the back edge like the other netbook high capacity batteries do .
28                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I like it a lot  the battery and charger problems I feared so much have not materialized .
29                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I am still a little worried about that battery thing .
30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I may have left you with some question about the battery and charging system, , I am sorry about that .
31                                                                                                                                                                                                                  After almost two months of using my new Eee PC 1005HA I can report no problem with the battery, bringing the battery to a full charge   or the charging brick itself .
32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 My Jabra bluetooth headset works great with Skype, I've gotten 6 hours on my battery watching movies, listening to music   before plugging it back in .
33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Two other things that make this a superior computer are battery life, and the LED backlighting for the screen .
34                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The backlighting is definitely a factor in the longer battery charge life, but it also makes for a very nice bright picture .
35                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               For the average user the battery charge life will be a plesant surprise .
36                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    faster overall performance, and shorter charge life on the battery .
37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            When I recently started looking into purchasing a netbook, I was impressed with the battery life of the Asus Eee PC 1000HE .
38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          When I found out about the Dell Mini 10v coming out, I ordered one with upgrades to a six cell battery and larger hard drive .
39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    To make a long story short, the track pad buttons   are a nightmare and the battery protruding on the bottom is an ugly compromise .
40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Add the high running temperature to the poorer than expected battery life, and the Dell went back .

70                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The first day I got it I used it for at least 7 hours and Windows still said it had an hour and a half battery life left before I decided to charge it .
71                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         All in all, great product, great battery life .
72                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             This thing has great battery life, fits in the glove box of my car, and serves the uses of a netbook in excellent fashion .
73                                                                                                                                   My only other gripe is the speakers are very weak for media use, but there are pocket, able battery powered speaker options, I am using the Altec Lansing Orbit Altec Lansing iM, 237 Orbit Ultraportable Speaker for MP3 Players  , which is great .
74                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Luckily this thing has a great battery life our I'd be out of luck .
75                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                But the strongest feature to recommend the machine is the battery life .
76                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I expected six or seven hours in reality, , I'm aware that battery life claims, like MPGs with cars, are usually puffed up .
77                                                                                                                                                               If your primary needs are portability and epic battery life, so that you never have to worry about sitting near a power outlet when you're on the go, and you want good construction   then this is the machine for you .
78              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .
79                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     While this is still a fine machine, battery life has started dropping off already .
80                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        My 10, hour battery is now a 7 .
81                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The battery arrived pre, charged .
82                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             When putting the battery on, it nearly doubles the weight of the computer .
83                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I have been able to make the battery expectancy get up the reported 10 .
84                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0 out of 5 stars Would have been 5 stars except for failed battery and failed ac adapter .
85                                                                                                                                                                   4 PASS ,  Battery life is amazing, used the laptop in  Super Performance Mode  for over 6 hours of watching videos, checking email, connecting with USB Verizon broadband card, and still had battery life leftover .
86                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1 FAIL ,  After one charge cycle, the battery blew a circuit, and would no longer power the netbook .

89                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Seriously, I felt extravagant and almost guilty when he noted the 10 hour battery life on my Asus .
90                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Of course, without the adapter you can't charge the battery or operate the computer .

116                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I actually went without charging it for more than a day because the battery life is just so amazing .
117                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                With such a great battery life, keyboard and responsive touch pad, there's really no other model that can hold a candle to this puppy .
118                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               My battery recharger failed within 24 hours, I returned it and received no notification that a replacement was shipped .
119                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        3 megapixel camera, the n280 atom processor, a 6, cell battery, and much more .
120                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I bought this about 3 weeks ago, and just until now, the charger wont completely charge the battery .
121                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The warranty card plainly states that the warranty covers everything but, the battery or free accessories such as mice or laptop bag .
122                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The battery is spectacular, and the key board didn't take any time getting used to, and of course it is a very cute cool little gadget .
123                                                                                                                       I had a 2 year old dell that just gave me problems so often, and recently the warrenty went out, coincidentally the battery's connection malfunctioned so it had to stay plugged in and the internet could not be detected, while my parents laptops were fine .
124                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1005ha has Longer battery life and $30 cheaper, plus people complained about the port covers getting annoying in the 1008 .
125                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             And you can upgrade the ram and remove the battery to be replaced in a few years, or buy another battery to carry around .
126                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The 1008ha you would have to ship into the Asus company to get a new battery upgrade for ram, which will cost something .

128                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Sure this one has a larger battery .
129                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The keyboard is easy to type on  , the battery life is great, and I've found that I really do like the touch pad with all its features .

131                                                                                                                                                                                                       , around the house, i can freely roam to wherever i find comfortable or least noisy, NEVER having to worry about the power cord because of the seemingly infinite battery life .

133                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Full sized laptops are so freaking bulky, heavy, and the battery wouldnt even make it though one of my evening classes .
134                            Her computer is a top of the line notebook that never leaves her desk because of bulkiness and pathetic battery life, so her only backdrop is the block wall of her dorm XD but with this eeepc, she never sees me in the same place twice, and almost all of the time im outside, far from buildings which really says something about the wireless card .
135                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The reason I went with Asus is the long battery life without the huge bump in the back   ,  a fast processer, easy memory upgrade, good looks and great price .
136                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I bought this to use when traveling within a developing country, where I need lots of battery life and don't feel like lugging around my conspicuous   15  notebook .
137                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Good battery life under Linux about 7 .

139                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Its battery life is much longer ,  though not quite the stated 10 .
140                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The 6, cell lithium, ion battery is seamless integrated into the mainframe to minimize space usage .
141                                     Now add in the N, standard wireless, free netbook sleeve and the usual laptop microphone   webcam suite, and together with its aforementioned compactness and long battery life, it becomes possible to do productive work on the Asus Eee HA1005 ,  maintaining web sites, writing long articles, coding, e, networking, etc ,  almost anywhere .

146                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The use of WIFI also seems to drain the battery, but just not as quickly .

154                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Battery life is over 8 hours and I plan to upgrade the memory soon .

156  One of the downside I have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .

183                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   When I put back the factory memory the machine worked perfectly on A C and battery .
184                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Our unit has operated flawlessly so far and the 10 hour battery is a real plus .

186                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Great battery life, decent sized screen, and the keyboard was large enough to be comfortable to type on .
187                                                                                                                               I originally bought the EEE to take with me whenever my laptop was too big to take somewhere, but have started exclusively using the EEE in place of my laptop because of its portability and battery life that greatly exceeds most full size laptops .
188                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The only minor issue is that the battery life is a bit less after the Windows 7 upgrade .
189                                                                                                                                                                                           What none of the reviews I read told me is that the Asus company recommends that when you are somewhere that has electricity, you should take out the battery and just plug in the machine .
190                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               They said there are only so many recharges in the life of any battery, and when you don't have to use the battery, it extends its life .
191                                                                                                                                                                                         One of the reasons I chose this netbook was that the battery does come out ,  my old laptop had an internal battery, and when it stopped taking a charge, I had to replace the whole machine .
192                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     So I decided that whatever I buy has to have a removable battery .

201                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I'm glad I did, I charged the battery before attempting anything .
202                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I mention the battery life which I usually get about 8 hours with full brightness, playing videos or music, and have multiple programs running simultaneously .
203                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I needed a computer easy to move, to work efficiently and with long battery life and that was precisely what I got .
204                                                                                                                        This did not affect me much, I can write without problems full university texts, media files run without any problem   and the battery have been used for seven consecutive hours using the computer to the maximum in High Performance Mode without depleted .
205                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The advantages over Acer and HP are in the best battery and the magnificent instalation that comes with the computer .

300                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The battery doesn't add much bulk to the overall unit at all either .
301                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      For this extra amount, I was looking for the larger screen, the longer battery life and the keyboard ergonomics .
302                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I haven't put it to the test on how long it actually lasts, but I use it off and on all day and I've never had the battery go dead on me .
303                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The long battery life is on and off .
304                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Sometimes it says that I have 70% battery life AND 3hrs :
305                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Saying that, I don't have any battery saving settings set as I'm not too familiar with that and haven't had the need .
306                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The sound wasn't all that great but hooking up some battery op speakers or headphones would be the way to go there .
307                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The battery life last almost 4 hours with contine use but I have the battery charger that charges in no time .
308                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I can easily get 8 hours on the battery life while running multiple programs and listening to music over the wireless internet .

11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The little power button at the top of the Kindle is really a power slide .
12                                                                                                                                                                                                 The change in the hinging and size of the buttons is major plus and would make it hard to go back to the K1 .
13                                                                                                                                                 sleeker look and feel  , sharper screen, no longer accidentally depressing the next page button by accident and having to find your place in the book again .
14                                                                                                                                                                           ,  The 5, way button, though a bit small, allows you to select left and right, and not just up and down like the original version .
15                                                                                                       Only issue is I need to recalibrate now, , in general, I try to anticipate how much time it will take the next page to load, and when I'm two lines from the bottom, I would hit the next page button .
16                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Now I need to push the button later .
17                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               That 5, way button is magical .
18                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The main issue I had with Kindle 1 was the navigation button design and placement .
19                                                                                                                                                                     I like to read holding the Kindle with one hand and it just didn't work well because I kept bumping the next, previous and back buttons .
20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The display is better and the 5, way button is a major improvement .
21                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     On off buttons are repositioned to be easily accessible .
22    Things like the buttons that made it easy to accidentally turn pages  the separate cursor on the side that could only select lines and was sometimes hard to see  the occasionally awkward menus  the case which practically forced you to remove it to use it and sometimes pulled the battery door off .
23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The second thing is the buttons .
24                                                                                                                                                                                           This means that when you handle the Kindle 2 by the edges, the pages don't change even if you grab by the buttons .
25                                                                                                                                              Yet changing pages is effortless when you do ,  the buttons are right between your thumbs and the slightest pressure on their faces is enough to activate them .
26                                                                                                          That it doesn't have the quirky, clunky, annoying buttons that filled ¾ of each side of its predecessor, buttons that caused dozens upon dozens of accidental page turns makes it that much sexier .
27                                                                                                                                                                                                                     What I like most about the Kindle 2 is the placement of the buttons and their inversion .
28                                                                                                                                                                                                              It has the feel of the mouse button in the middle of a laptop keyboard and I never liked those .
29                                                                                                                                                                                                   Manipulating that button reminded me of something I'd rather not think about when trying to get work done .
30                                                                                                                                      if you don't upgrade, you will regret it every time you accidentally hit one of the obscenely large buttons and advance or retreat one, two, three, or even four pages .
31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The page turn buttons are better .
32                                                                                                                                                                                                                   With the Kindle 1, I was constantly at risk of accidentally bumping the next page buttons .
33                                                                                                                                                                                            With the Kindle 2, the buttons have been scaled down to a much more manageable size and are a lot less sensitive .
34                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I love the 4, way directional button .
35                                                                  It took a little getting used to after having used the Kindle 1, especially since the context menus that I was used to in the first gen have changed due to the new directional button, but for any Kindle user, this change is a god send .
36                                                                                                                                                                                  It looks good, feels good in the hand, has good buttons, which are easy to operate on purpose but not so easy accidentally .
37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           A button click brings up the dictionary, starting with that entry .
38                                                                                                                                                                                                                      It's very easy to page forward or backward through the text with the dedicated buttons .
39                                                                                                      The button layout looks odd because it's so regularly spaced in rows versus the keyboard's staggered style, but it isn't any harder to use than a cellphone's tri, letter entry or blackberry keyboard .
40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The buttons are not hard to press at all .
41                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Every K2 button has a satisfying 
42                                                                                                                                       Just like how I prefer to grasp the page a few sentences before the end of a page, I tend to press the  Next Page  button a bit sooner than I finish reading the page .
43                                                                                        The lag actually helps in that respect, and even so, the lag between pushing the button and the new page appearing is much faster than I could ever physically flip any book page without shearing it from the spine .

46                                                                                                                                                                                                     when I received my Kindle 2 I was very impressed with the design, especially the improved button design .
47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Tiny buttons with even tinier text on the buttons .
48                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The incredibly tiny buttons are literally impossible for people with low, vision to read .
49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And the tiny buttons with the even tinier text ?
50                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Greatly improved page turning buttons .
51                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The codes vary depending on which button I press and the most recent code has been 90UGC .
52                                                                 Each time this has happened, I have contacted the support team, each time the team member has made me delete the book from the device,they've resent it to me and I've had to do the hold the power button for 20 seconds process each time .
53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I'm not crazy about the way that the scroll button works either .
54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The buttons and the controller work smoothly .
55                                                                                           Sleek style, easy to hold, the white causes it to disappear as suggested in its description, highly transportable, well thought out button placement, easy to use, adjustable font, ease of downloading new books .
56                                                                                                                                                                                              I love how the content manager is better integrated and I don't have to hit so many buttons to manage my books .
57                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            What I hate ,  I hate the new button positioning .
58                                                                                                                                                              Since the K2 is longer and the buttons are near the bottom, its awkward to hold and feels unbalanced in my hands, almost like it will tip over .
59                                                                                                                                                                                                                             When I'm trying to go to the next page, I hit the home button by accident a lot .
60                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I also hate the fact that you really have to push the buttons hard to change the page .
61                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I really liked the extra responsiveness of the K1 buttons   .
62                                                                                                                                                                                                            However I was disappointed to discover that I was unable to press the buttons from that position .
63                                                                                                                                                                                             With the K2 I can turn on the TTS feature with one button, place it beside me, and have it read to me all night !
64                                                                                                                                                                                        I contemplated changes to my beloved Kindle with dread, I was one of the few who loved the old page, turning buttons .
65                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I worried that the new buttons would be Sony Reader size, and impossible for me to press .
66                                                                                                                                                                   Thankfully the buttons are still at least thumb, size, and may appear hard to press, until you realize that they are hinged on the inside .
67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I like the new size and feel of the buttons .
68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  It is much harder now to accidentally hit the page buttons .
69                                                                                                                                                                                                                               But holding the darn thing was a chore without pressing that next button page .
70                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Kind of hard to do when you're inadvertently pressing buttons .
71                                                                                                                                                                                              Also the keyboard has been redesigned to make things easier as well as added buttons like  menu  which is nice .
72                                                                                                                                            I find myself using a large size typeface to compensate for the lack of contrast, but this means frequent  next page  button presses which is extremely annoying .
73                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The buttons have a cheap feel .
74                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The  next page  buttons should activate when pressed at any angle .
75                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Upgrade the quality of the hardware especially the buttons .

77                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The next, previous, back buttons are much smaller and are hard to hit accidentally .
78                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The keyboard buttons are small, round, low, profile and have slightly convex tops .
79                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The on, off button is now on top and the radio on, off switch is now in a software menu .

81                                                                                                                                                                                      My thanks to  Arts&HistoryFan  for pointing out that when you hit the menu button, the time is shown in the top banner .
82                                                                                                       Yes, I noticed some of the initial design flaws in the first, generation Kindle ,  the placement of the  next page  buttons, the general sense of flimsiness ,  but I decided I could live with those .
83                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Opened the box, press the button and it begins downloading books that I pre, ordered .
84                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The welcome screen comes on to explain all the buttons .
85                                                                                                                                                                               One thing I didn't like was the page next button failed to work when the text to speech was in use and I wanted to skip ahead .
86                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             sym button depressed at same time
87                                                                                                                                                                 Buttons are accessible, raised for convenience of all involved ,  another big plus for the visually impaired or those with other conditions .
88                                                                                       The sound button is raised only slightly ,  fine for VI but potentially problematic for those with arthritis or other issues with fine motor function as it is a relatively thin button that must be pressed slightly .
89                                                                                                                                                                                        The buttons are well placed and need a good push to change pages, but not so much that it detracts from your reading .
90                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Navigation is much easier with the 5, way button .
91                                                                                                                                                               I miss having a dedicated button to deactivate the wireess, but the overall device has improved so much that I will get over the loss quickly .
92                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Buttons are not hard to press for me .
93                                                                                                                                                                      They do require a bit of pressure, but I like it that way so I can rest my thumbs on the buttons without turning the page accidentally .
94                                                                                                          They seem to be in the perfect location, I can grip the K2 easily and do not have to worry about pressing a button on accident but when I need to change the page they are right where I want them .
95                                                                                                                                    Moving the cursor to the word in question can be a bit awkward since there is some delay using the 5 direction button, but it's not so awkward as to not use the feature .
96                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Getting a free sample wirelessly and then just hitting a button to buy it is great .
97                                                                                                                                                                   I hate tiny gadgets with tiny screens covered with tiny buttons that lead to a labyrinth of tiny submenus filled with nonsensical options .
98                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Click a button and it's there in seconds .
99                                                                                                                                        The buttons have been made smaller, which fixed the large buttons on the lst generation that made the device hard to hold and frustratingly easy to advance the page .
100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,  One button to turn on, turn off, and sleep .
101                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I also like the fact the button is on the top and not on the back as it was on the K1 .
102                                                                                                                                                                                  I just have to use the new five way button to highlight the word and look up shows at the bottom without leaving the page .
103                                                                                                                                                                                                                         significant improvement over Kindle 1's non intuitive forward and previous buttons .
104                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Also I'm afraid that overusing the mouse button may cause it to wear out quickly .
105                                                                                                                                                                   If you wish to go back say a dozen pages to look up something you simply have to press the 'previous page' button 12 times in succession .
106                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Again navigation is by using the next and previous page buttons .
107                                                                                                                                                                My mother, in, law has enough difficulty with her fingers and the tiny buttons that she generally uses a pencil, eraser to push the buttons .
108                                                                                                                                                                                    When you look at it, if you don't focus too hard, the little buttons and controls fade away and all you see is the text .
109                                                                                                       The only thing you can do is rotate, which makes some PDFs readable but then you're in the awkward position of having to press the next and previous page buttons vertically instead of horizontally .
110                                                                                                                                                                                                       One day while laying on the couch reading I pressed the 'next page' button and the screen went blank .

112                                                                                                                           My one complaint is that I'd like a  previous page  button on both side of the screen, the way there's a  next page  button on both sides, but that's a very minor consideration .
113                                                                                                                                             Reading the book in the cover isn't a problem as the front cover readily folds around to the back so that it isn't making the left, edge buttons hard to press .
114                                                                                                                                                               To use the  enter  function, that is to execute a command or enter the text I've typed in, I just have to push downward on the square button .
115                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The prev next back home buttons are too small ?
116                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Add a prev page button on the right and a home button on the left .
117                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Next page and other buttons ,  very easy to use .
118                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The buttons really are much better .
119                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I also found using the navigation button difficult .
120                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The size and buttons are fine with me .
121                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The new navigation button works well, and the keyboard   feels good to my fingers .
122                                                                                                                                                                                   The buttons are also laid out and I'm so glad they put the  Next  buttons on both sides since it makes it so easy to use .
123                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The Qwerty keyboard, while the buttons are small, is spaced nicely for ease of use .
124                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I find the Kindle buttons perfect for this type of device .
125                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I find the buttons easy to use .
126                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ,  I find the myriad of buttons on the face of the device to be very nicely done .
127                                                                                                                                 As highly documented before, the buttons on the side of the device used for page turning, going to the home screen, and accessing the menu all engage with an inward click .
128                                                                                                                                                                                                                         This enables you to pick up the device with the edges without pressing any buttons .
129                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               They buttons are well placed .
130                                                                                                    The page turning buttons are a lot easier to hit than say, flipping a page in a real book while lying in bed, having said page get caught up on the covers, and having to adjust to get it squared away .
131                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The major buttons on both sides are for the next page .
132                                                                                                                                                                                                 For some reason, my brain wants a prior page button on the left side and the next page button on the right .
133                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I hit the page button once and looked left as though I had turned an actual page in a book .
134                                                                                                                                                                                                     A minor grumble, I keep wanting to press Next Page rather than the select button to make things happen .
135                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Its the position of the buttons that seems to make me want to do that .
136                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I intuitively want the biggest button to be 'select' rather than Next Page .
137                                                                                                                                                                                                              Your finger can rest on the  next page  button, and a simple click is all you need to advance .
138                                                                                                                                                                                                                       When you hold it in the opposite hand, the next page button is on the other side too .
139                                                                                                                              I don't need two hands to hold the book open when I'm on the train, or whenever, just one hand gives you good access to all the buttons even while you are holding the device .
140                                                                                                                                                      I also love the fact they made the next and previous page buttons a little bit harder to push so I am not constantly pressing buttons I don't mean to .
141                                                                                                                                                                     The buttons work well even with my large fingers and the navigating 5, position control is easily mastered and easy to use effectively .
142                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , new buttons are a massive step up .
143                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You can hold the buttons on the edge and not turn pages .

148                                                                                                                                                                                                      Previous button presses inward, toward the screen, while other buttons press toward the outside edges .

151                                                                                                                                         When I purchased the Kindle originally, I had several issues with the physical layout, the inability to stop the  accidental  button pushing and the sharp corners .
152                                                                                                                                                In the Kindle 2, the corners have been rounded and the buttons have been restructured so that it takes a little pressure to press inward instead of outward .
153                                                                                                                                                                                                            The placement of the on off button is much better at the top rather than the back as previously .
154                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I really enjoy the menu button and the 5, way controller to navigate .
155                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The buttons rubbed the fingers at the bottom .
156                                                                                                                                                                                                                             On the Kindle 2, the button has been moved to the top right side of the device .
157                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The keyboard buttons are smaller and also require some pressure to activate .
158                                                                                                                                                What remains to be seen, however, is whether the Kindle 2 will be plagued with having to be reset as frequently as the Kindle, nor did I see a reset button .
159                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I love the  next page  button on both sides of the Kindle 2 .
160                                                                                                                                                     The buttons on the K2 are not easily pressed while reading, and I love the 5, way button that allows me to easily navigate between my newpaper pages   .
161                                                                                                                                                     I flicked the switch to start reading, and the screen froze with a bunch of lines on it that would flicker a bit when I hit a button, but that was all .
162                                                                                                                                                                                        There is no 1, 800 number for Canada for Kindle support, so you request them to call you via a button on their site .
163                                                                                                                                                                                                             I hit the button, bent over to plug in the Kindle, and the phone rang before I straightened up ."

100   my first fill up was 26 mpg mixed city and hwy I only expect it to get better, steering is tight and precise, only complaints are road noise is more than i like but its livable, rain or just dew pours in right on top of the power window controls when the window is cracked, but window guards have fixed that, its a fun car to drive, and for what it is, its comfortable, controls are great, easy to reach, I'm looking forward to a lot of great miles with this car .

117                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I am extremely satisfied after the first week  though it was more costly, I still like the smooth power and handling of the V, 6, the comfort of the leather interior, and something new for me .

125                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Comfort is my only real complaint .

2                                                                                                                                                                             Good gas mileage, comfortable seating, lots of leg room .
3                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lots of comfort for the price .
4                                                                                                                                                                                                The ride is loud and not comfortable .
5                                                                                                                                                               I drive 2 hours to work each day and it is just not comfortable to me .
6                                                                                                                                         Getting about 26 mpg mixed city hwy with conservative driving, seating 4 people comfortably .
7                                                                                                                                                                                                   The ride is quiet and comfortable .
8                                                                                                                         Styling is bland, the engine isn't strong at all, and the car doesn't deliver good comfort while driving it .
9                                                                                                                                                                                                 The seats aren't comfortable either .
10                                                                                                                                                                                                It is relatively comfortable inside .
11                                             It's a pretty good car, reliable, comfortable as far as it goes, but limited rear visibility because of high rear bumper, and a problem with its computer  learning  my  driving style .
12                                                                                                                                                                             The driver seat is still soft and mostly uncomfortable .
13                                                                                                                                  The ride is comfortable and it seems to ride a little higher than the average sedan, which I like .
14                                                                                                                                            I've had 3 BMWs and only one of them could offer a more comfortable ride than the Camry .
15                                                                                                                                                                                               Second the internal comfort id awful .
16                                                                                                                 The previous soft seats were replaced with hard cheap ones which are very very uncomfortable and give me back pain .
17                                                                                                                                             If you keep in mind that the Camry is a comfort car, you may even enjoy the experience .
18                                                                                                         While the 4 cylinder does not have the punch of the Honda Accord 4 cylinder, the comfort and quietness of the ride won out .
19                                                                                                                                                                                  No hestitation, comfort is great in front in back .
20                                                                                                                                                                       I feel uncomfortable driving this car and will get rid of it .
21                                                                                                                                                                                                    Very comfortable, great styling .
22                                                                                                                                     I was surprised by how quiet the cabin was and just how comfortable it was to sit in and drive .
23                                                                                                                                   This car offers poor driver's seat comfort, poor vision  , only average ride quality, gas mileage 
24                                                                        We have had this Camry about two years now, and it is not a boring car but it is smooth, comfortable and has good road manner, and overall it is a good car .
25                                                                                                                          I'd highly recommend anyone buy this car if they are seeking an affordable, comfortable, reliable vehicle .
26                                                                                                                                                     You can not get that comfort with any other automaker other than perhaps Honda .
27                                                                                                                                                                                Looks are great and interior is comfortable, but it ?
28                                                                                                                                                    I needed a comfortable commuter that I could also run around with the family in .
29                                                                                                                                    great ride, quiet comfortable spacious cabin, superior electronics  , fair price and good looks .
30                                                                                                         You can't have it both ways, either a car is full of power and stiff suspension or it's smooth and comfortable on the road .
31                                                                                                                                 The interior is very luxurious and comfortable, however the car feels slower than my 2002 Camry LE .
32                                                                                                                                                                    For the comfort and entertainment of the ride, I like the Camry .
33                                                                                                                                                                                            The driver's seat is really comfortable .
34                                                                                             I have had no transmission issues or rattling, the comfort and ride of this vehicle felt to me much more high end then what I had paid .
35                                                                                                                                                                    I love the look, and the comfort, but would never buy one again .
36    I've read other reviews stating that the leather seats were not comfortable for long drives due to lack of cushion support, but that's not been the case for me especially after recently driving from Houston to Key West, Fla .
37                                                                                                                                                                                                    The seats were very comfortable .
38                                                                                                                                         The car comfort, looks, performance and fuel economy are great but the paint is a disaster .
39                                                                                                                                                                                       Front seats are not comfortable on long trip .
40                                                                                                I was not sure at first about trading my 01 Honda Accord but have been more than satisfied with the performance, looks, and comfort .
41                                                                                                                                       A little stiffer ride than the xl and xle models I have had, but still comfortable and quiet .
42                                                                                                                                                                                                  Very comfortable ride and seating .
43                                                                                                                                                                 Very low interior noise level, which adds to the long trip comfort .
44                                                                                                The ride, comfort, and drive is as expected, however, the quality and reputation of yore are completely gone for the flagship Camry .
45                                                                                       Over the month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort and options of the Camry .
46                                                                                                     The seat comfort is not as it was and I found that the gas, brake pedals are offset too much to the left of my body centerline .

49                                                                                                                                                           Feels expensive, yet comfortable with larger interior than my Grand Prix .

53                                                                                                                     It looks awesome, turns like it's on rails, has a great sound system, and is just comfortable and fun to drive .

58                                                                                                                                          For the price I couldn't have asked for a better performing, comfortable and stylish whip .
59                                                                                                                                                                                              The seating is relatively comfortable .

61                                                                                                                                                                  I'm 6'3  and I find this car very comfortable to drive or ride in .
62                                                                                                                                     My friends say my car is just like a Lexus and I have to agree, very comfortable and beautiful .
63                                                                                                                                           Seats are comfortable, but wish the seat bottoms tilted back more into a bucket position .
64                                                                                                                                                                                         Solid, high quality, comfortable and quiet .

66                                                                                                                                                                                           Superb handling, performance and comfort .
67                                                                                                                                                                Turns out, it was one of the smoothest, most comfortable rides ever .
68                                                                                                                                                                I bought this car smitten by its exterior look and interior comfort .
69                                                                                                                                                                                Yes, it is very comfortable, esp for the price paid .
70                                                                                                                                                                            Very quiet and comfortable ride, more than enough power .
71                                                                                                                                                                                                It is very reliable and comfortable .
72                                                                                                                                                      It's very comfortable and a quiet ride with low levels of road and wind noise .
73                                                                                                                                                            The seats are way to low to the ground making long drives uncomfortable .
74                                                                                                                                                 I do not find the front seats as comfortable as the seats in my old 96 Ford taurus .
75                                                                                                                Toyota made many improvements since 03, including more comfortable front seats, better rear seat room and comfort   .
76                                                                                                                                                                                            Very comfortable, quite and smooth ride .
77                                                                              The sound system is incredible, the seats are comfortable, the controls are ergonomic and straight forward and the take off power is quite impressive .
78                                                                                                                                           My passengers are expecially happy with it and love the room, comfort, and adjustability .
79                                                                                                 On longer trips, however, they have a tendency to fall asleep, , which I think emphasizes how comfortable, smooth, and quiet it is .
80                                                                                                                                          It is a very comfortable car that gives us options that we never had on previous vehicles .
81                                               I test drove and compared similar 4 door sedans like the Maxima, Accord, Mazda6, and noticed that none had all the features,performance,comfort ,safety,and looks that the Camry has .
82                                                                                                                                                                                 The navigation works flawlessly, comfortable seats .
83                                                                                                                                                                 I have to say the car rode great,comfortable and gas mileage great .
84                                                                                                                                   I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a comfortable ride as well as good fuel economy .
85                                                                                                                             The seats were very comfortable on a four and a half hour   trip, and wind and road noise were minimal .
86                                                                                                                                 The interior is much more comfortable than my last 3 Camrys and the exterior styling is oh so chic .
87                                                                                                                                                                                   Comfortable and quiet with excellent gas mileage .
88                                                                                                                           Comfort is great, mileage is good overall, better on the road than expected  , compared to my 1999 Camry .
89                                                                                   Having flown 26 different aircraft and driven cars for 61 years, I find the 2007 Camry to be the most uncomfortable cockpit I have every been in .
90                                                                                                The headrest presses into my head at an uncomfortable angle and it is imposssible to tell where the front of the car is for parking .
91                                                                                                                                                              The window sill is too high and the armrest too low to be comfortable .
92                                                                                                        The new looks are what attracted it to me initially, but its relatively smooth drive, comfort and reliability sold me on it .

94                             The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of leg room .
95                                                                                                                                                                                            It is so comfortable and drives perfect .
96                                                                                                              Overall this car is very quiet, comfortable, smooth, powerful, and absolutly the best mid, size in the current market .
97                                                                                                                                                                           Leather seats are comfortable, Nav system is easy to use .
98                                                                I only have a vibration shimmy problem at 70 mph, visited dealer three times and ended up with changing a new tire and now the ride is even quieter and comfortable .
99                                                                                                                                                                                                     Leather seats were comfortable .
100                                                                                                                                                                                                 Leather interior very comfortable .
101                                                                                                                                My conclusion after doing a ton of research regarding safety, reliability, comfort and gas mileage :
102                                                                                                                           the Hyundai Sonata is thousands of dollars cheaper and matches the Camry in all respects except comfort .
103                                                                                        Bottom line was that I was going to be in that driver's seat for years to come and I was not going to skimp on the critical comfort factor .
104                                                                                                                                                While the '03 was roomy and comfortable, the steering and handling were very vague .
105                           The interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields greater comfort .
106                                                                                                                                                   , a luxurious comfort feature, and a fuel consumption that is best in the class .
107                                                                                                                                              Nice looking interior but seats are very hard and are not comfortable for long trips .
108                                                                                                                                                                                              Top notch rating on interior comfort .
109                                                                                                                                      The car is VERY comfortable and the air conditioning is perfect for the heat here in Arizona .

111                                                                                                                                                 I purchased a Camry LE approximately 2 months ago, it's a smooth comfortable ride .
112                                                                                                                                                                              I selected the Camry for its comfort and reliability .
113                                                                                                                                                                This new Camry is indeed very comfortable with quiet and soft ride .
114                                                                                                                                                                                    Very uncomfortable when driving long distances .
115                                                                                                                            I am not real fond of the electric seat and I find it is not as comfortable as my F150 pickup on trips .
116                                                                                                                                                                      This car is easy to drive, great gas mileage and comfortable .
117                                                                                                                                     However, when we drove the Camry we were impressed with its looks and the comfort of the ride ."

5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Garmin's nuvi 255W   is a handy little device that provides excellent value, but more importantly spot on directions .
6                                                 While I recommend that you refrain from entering a directions request while driving your car, I note that some of the more impressive features of this GPS are literally one touch away, and so mounting the device close enough to you to activite a one touch feature would seem to be relatively important .
7                                                                                                       But leaving it on the seat next to you is likely to cause a few double takes because as comfortable as you think you're going to be just listening for directions, the fact remains that the graphics will attract your eyeballs like a moth to a flame .
8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I've found the directions in major metropolitan areas to be excellent .

10                                                                                                                                         Another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .
11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I like how the Garmin 255W doesn't make you type in complete directions when it isn't necessary .
12                                                                                                                                       The only other annoyance of any time is that if you deviate from your route and don't indicate that you are detouring, you get to hear the Garmin repeatedly chastize you because it has to recalulate your directions .

14                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     It speaks the directions so that you don't have to keep looking down at a piece of paper .

18                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          In closing, this is a fantastic GPS with some very nice features and is very accurate in directions .
19                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The sound is tolerable, but when you are hearing spoken directions a lot, it gets really annoying .

25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Gives you immediate directions to get to the location you chose to set up as your home location .
26                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Allows you to type in two street names, and if they intersect, the GPS unit will give you directions to that intersection .
27                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               You can touch anywhere on the map and press GO for directions to that location .
28                                                                                                                                                                                                         Shows you your current latitude and longitude location, and allows you to enter new coordinates to set up so you can get directions to that location .
29                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            If you missed the spoken directions, you can look at the top of the screen for written directions .
30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         However, I much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .
31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Some of the verbal directions :
32                                                                                                                                                                        It should tell me to take the Southwest Drive exit, or the Buffalo Gap Road exit, like the highway sign says, or like I would verbally tell someone to take if giving them directions .
33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            So, although the Nuvi doesn't verbalize those directions, I can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .
34                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Directions seemed to focus on Interstate travel and I have not played with the device enough to know if it can be set to avoid Interstates .
35                                                                                                                                                                                                                       It lost satellite contact a couple of times on the trip   but apparently picked them up again because there were no skipped directions .
36                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Directions were easy to see and understand .
37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The spoken directions are generally easy to understand .
38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Since the directions are also displayed on the screen, I find the occasional mispronunciation entertaining and not an issue .
39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   It does know when you are not near a public road but it cannot give directions to the road .
40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The spoken turn, by, turn directions are clear and very timely .
41   My only real gripes on the software interface side would be its inability to show 1, way streets on your overhead map   and that this particular model does not support the Garmin routing feature that you can sync between your PC and their more expensive models to pick multiple waypoints instead of just a point 'A' to point 'B' directions system .
42                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You can even get turn, by, turn directions from the program, and Google Maps has features that work with Garmin units .
43                                                                                                                                         Any time you're facing a closed roadway or are terribly stuck in highway traffic, you'll get a very slick change in directions to your destination given to you in literally less than 5 seconds than you ask for it .

45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The purpose of the GPS is to give me directions in unfamiliar locations .
46                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .
47                                                                                                                                                                 It takes a little while to get the satellites sometimes, but I just set it up as soon as I get in the car and by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .
48                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I had a great time torturing the poor thing and deliberately not following its directions while driving one day in downtown Sacramento .
49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      As with the 285WT, it gave me bad directions in one place in Sacramento .
50                                                                                                                                                                                     I avoided the more complex ones as I had read that FM updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .
51                                                                                                                                                                                        I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .
52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It loads quickly, have pretty accurate directions, and can recalculate quickly when I miss a turn .
53                                                                                                                                                                                                        Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .
54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The directions were pretty right on, with a brief glitch with the distance it was calculating for some approaching streets .
55                                                                                                                                                                                                     I am sure I've not even touched upon the many features this GPS boasts, but for basic travel directions for the non, techie then this is a great product .
56                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          My daughter would then call my wife, asking her to plot a course using a mapping Web site and recite the directions .
57                                                                                                                   Daughter Dearest now carries the Nuvi in the glove box of her car, pulling it out, plugging it in, and getting directions whenever she needs, in a manner that notably is much faster and clearer than reading a map or calling her mother .
58                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    When it comes to directions, I'm horrible .
59                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .

63                                                                                                                                    The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .

67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        It has worked well for local driving giving accurate directions for roads and streets .
68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I was so tired of having to go to Mapquest and print out directions .

3                                                                                                                                                                                     The 255 also automatically adjusts the font size of displayed text so that even lengthy text will fit .
4                                                                                                                                        Another feature on the 255w is a display of the posted speed limit on the road which you are currently on right above your current displayed speed .
5                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The 255W has a really clear display that's easy to see in any light .
6                                                                                                              The new display posts speed limit signs of major roads flush left on the screen, which is a new feature that is also really helpful, if you're driving in an unfamiliar area .
7                              The widescreen display makes it possible to view the names of roads that you are passing on the screen, , which makes it much easier to differentiate between which road to turn on when there are two streets on your right   that are only one house apart .
8                                                                                                                                                                                                  The bad ,  My unit only displays elevation contours at zoom levels of 20 miles or higher .
9                                                                                                                                       UPDATE ON THIS ,  It finally turned out that to see the elevation contours at lower zoom levels   you have to reduce the amount of detail displayed .
10                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I also miss the display of how far you have yet to go on your route .
11                                                                                                                                                                                                  My old unit counts this down for you and provides an estimate of ETA on the map display .
12                                                                                                                                                                                      I have to hit too many buttons to get back to the map display when, for example, I am entering POIs .
13                                                                                        Display is excellent ,  the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom .
14                                                                                                     In the map view, if you touch the display button to the left of the  Menu  button  , it brings up a display that features some stats about your trip and includes a compass of sorts .
15                                                                                                                The navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .
16                                                                                                                                                                                                  For me, the visual display combined with this level of verbal instruction is just right .
17                                                                                                                    So I finally got the Nuvi 255w after months of analizing and comparing wit other brands, adding 3 days of looking arownd in Circuit City and Best Buy stores displays .
18                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             It also can display and speak many languages .
19                                                                                                                                            I am thinking about buying another one of these for my parents because their native language is Chinese and Garmin 255W speaks and display it !
20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The display is great, and is very clear .
21                                                                                                                                                      The instructions sometimes are a little difficult to understand, but written at the top of the display is the next turn information .
22                                                                                                                                                                                                          The way map is displayed is good and the wide screen helps to see more map area .
23                                                                                                                                Through this option you can find sub, options which will allow you to change the language  , set display, navigation, time, map, and security preferences .
24                                                                                                                                                  The extra features of the 255W over lesser models that I find highly beneficial include spoken street names and the wide screen display .
25                                                                                                                                                              Since the directions are also displayed on the screen, I find the occasional mispronunciation entertaining and not an issue .
26                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I have checked the display in three areas I am familiar with :
27                                                                                                                                                                                                               But is impossible to display them and your current position simultaneously .
28                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Even setting the display to maximum detail is far from adequate .
29                                                                                                                                                                                    I have really sensitive eyes and sometimes the display is too much, but there is an adjustment for it .
30                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The display is extremely legible both in bright sunlight and at night .
31   I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .
32                                                                                                                                               ,  The speed limit sign on the display is handy but in the first week of using the GPS I found it had the wrong speed limit a couple times .
33                                                                                                                                                                                                     The unit speaks street names, has a beautiful display and a very intuitive interface .
34                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Also, if you're searching for a business, it displays the phone number .
35                                                                                                                                                                I also like the way the display changes background color for day and night and of course you have control of that as well .
36    I thought I had seen a turn by turn display but if you pick a location and wait at the GO icon you will see a Route Info slide out but it just tells you the distance and time, though if you tap on it it will show the map so you can zoom around and see the trip as it planned it .
37                                                                                                                                                                                Well when I saw that the 255W had the next turn proudly displayed in the upper left corner I jumped at it .
38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The Garmin has a nice 3d display .
39                                                                                                                                                                                                          One unexpected feature is the speed limit and actual speed displayed on the map .
40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I like the larger display and quicker updating of maps .

1                                    The dream has always been a portable electronic device that could hold a ton of reading material, automate subscriptions and facilitate quick easy downloads, and be as portable, as easy on the eyes, and as intuitive as a book .

13  I know I need to go to the optometrist, but the Kindle will aide and abet me in avoiding that for a while , ,  the page is easy to read, the font size is easy to change, and my eyes sail across the words, my finger hits next page without me giving it thought .

19                                  Text to speech is adequate, I don't see myself using this feature too much, but it's a lot better than nothing when you need both hands free, and it would be a truly fantastic feature for anyone with poor eyesight or blindness .

25                                                   The text, bumped up two magnification levels, is sharp and clear enough for me to make out, and while I've seen some criticism of the gray page background, I actually find it easier on my eyes than stark white .
26                                                                 For those of us in the Boomer bulge whose eyesight is failing and taking with it the pleasure of reading ,  and for those with other forms of visual impairment ,  it's nothing less than a miracle .
27                                                                                                                                         As advertised, it is very easy on the eyes, combined with font sizing and easy navigation this does what it was meant to do .

29                                                                                                                                                  I have been keeping an eye on the Kindle since the first was brought out and did a lot of research on this product .
30                                                                                                                                                                                                    and that is why it's easy on the eyes and uses very little power .
31                                                                                                                                                                                                               I use that as well when it gets late and my eyes tire .
32                                                                                                                                       The lights are casted from the side of the reader fusing towards the center, which caused me to experience severe eye, strain .

34                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I have not experienced eye, strain .
35                                                                                                                                                                    The illuminence of the light is equally distributed onto the screen which causes  no  eye strain .
36                                                                                                                                                                      Using the smaller font sizes causes eye strain except in daylight conditions with open windows .
37                                                                                                           And reading on the Kindle screen really is pleasant and natural, not to mention that my 47 year old eyes love the possibility of adjusting the text size  !
38                                                                                                                                                                                                                 First of all, the Kindle 2 is very easy on the eyes .
39                                                                                 Some have said they don't like the black text on a greyish background, but I find the contrast not only more than adequate but easier on the eyes than if the background were white .
40                                                                                                                                  A backlighted display is not easy on the eyes for hours on end and the Kindle 2 display is as nice to read as any traditional book .
41                                                                                                        I won't be using the feature much anyway because I get a lot more out of a book I'm reading with my eyes and hearing the voice of the storyteller in my mind .
42                                                                                                                                                                                                                      It's easier on the eyes not to have that light .
43                                                                                                                                                                              It's also easy to make the font larger whenever necessary, like when my eyes are tired .
44                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     E, ink hardly strains your eyes .
45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Truly, this helps in my eyes .
46                                                                                                                                                                    Easy on the eyes, font size can be changed and the book will even read to you if you want it too !
47                                                                                                                                                             Not having your eyeballs scorched, seared and scarred by the traditional computer screen is really nice .
48                                                                                                                           With the great technology of electronic ink, there isn't any back, lighting pounding relentlessly like the desert sun on your tender eyes .
49                                                                                                                                                                                                This means you can read for longer periods of time without eyestrain .
50                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The screen is so easy on the eyes .
51                                                                                                    The Kindle does not have a screen that taxes the eyes, and allows me to shift some of my time away from the computer for blogs that I would normally read online .
52                                                                                                                                                 It's lightweight and allows changes in font size that enables ease of reading no matter how tired your eyes may get .
53                                                                                                                                                     I do think the e, ink e, paper is a lot easier on my eyes for reading than the glossy or matte computer screens .
54                                                                                                                                                     The screen size is close enough to the size of a paperback book page that it hasn't caused my eyes any problems .
55                                                                                                                                                                                                              It looks very much like a book and is easy on the eyes .
56                                                                                                                                                                  8 E, Ink display is easy to read and doesn't strain your eyes and reads better than a printed page .
57                                                                                                                                                                                           I can strain to read the text but then close my eye for awhile and listen .
58                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,  Eye strain is completely non, existant in my experience .
59                                                                                                                                                                                         I would like to read on the way but my eyes get strained if I read on a bus .
60                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    It is also very easy on the eyes .
61                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I can make the font the perfect size for my eyes .
62                                                                                                                                                                              Although I'm turning pages quicker, my eyes are much less tired by using a bigger font .
63                                                                                                                                                 The screen is less obtrusive than the white of a book page, which also helps my eyes from growing tired too quickly .
64                                                                                                                                                           I finally got the Kindle, and my worries about the screen tiring my eyes while reading rapidly dissipated .
65                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It's easy on the eyes   and easy to hold .
66                                                                                                                                                                   I am 71 years old and read at least one or two books per week and this reader is easy on the eyes .
67                                                                                                                                                                      Searching for books and downloading them is fast and easy, the screen is very easy on the eyes .
68                                                                                                                                         Unfortunately my wife lost about 50 percent of her eyesight ten years ago and has not been able to enjoy reading since then .
69                                                                                                                                                                                            Adding one for  free  to the Kindle2 is just pulling wool over your eyes .
70                                                                                                                                                                                           As it gets lateI simply pump up the character size which eases tired eyes .
71                                                                      Now with the Kindle 2, I can change the print to suit my eyes and further, I can make more intelligent choices of books because I have more information of what is available at my finger tips .
72                                                                                                                                                         I am amazed at how easy the E Ink is on the eyes, the slight shadowing from page to page does not bother me .

74                                                                                                                                            The print is easy on the eye and the light weight of the device and easy to use controls make reading even more of a joy !

77                                                                                                                                                                                         I enjoy having the text at the largest size because there is less eyestrain .
78                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The e ink is so comfortable on the eyes ."

1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      All of these features combine to create a much improved and enjoyable desktop experience .

3                                                                                                                                                                                                              They showed me PC laptops that had more features than the MacBook, and which cost way less than the MacBook, too .
4                                                                                                                                                                                       But that aside, I like the availability of software, the new features like the improved Taskbar, Windows Peek, and the Aero environment .
5                                                                                                                                               If you're used to OS X, but want to come into the PC world where things cost less and you get more features, by all means consider Windows 7 the stepping stone to do just that .
6                                                                                                                                  After seeing the pricing on the newest MacBooks this week, and the limited features compared to what I currently own, I have to say that now is the right time to consider that switch to PC .
7                                                                                                                                                                                                                         These new features make the user experience much more superior than anything Windows has ever offered .
8                                                                                                                                 Also there are some other new things such as touch gesture features and disk encryption that normal users won't use either because it isn't needed or the hardware isn't widely adopted yet   .
9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You can read all the new features in your Windows 7 short version handbook .
10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           But what I really like about Windows 7 are the new and improved features it offers .
11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Also in Windows Explorer, two new features .
12                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                All the nifty new features mean squat if my computers don't function properly .
13                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , then Vista, but if so, none of its features have been impressive enough to have blown me away .
14                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              It does have some nice features .
15                                                                                                                                                                                                                 W7 is fast and resource friendly, every hardware device works perfect  , and there's a ton of great features .
16                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Runs well, but no stand out new features for my usage .
17                                                                                                                                                                         Having used Windows ME and XP for several years, and before upgrading, Vista, I heard a lot of great things about Windows 7, as well as new features .
18                                                                                                                                                                              I liked the built, in features of Vista and of course the appearance, but I prefered the stability and speed of XP even with a high, end system .
19                                                                                                                                                                                               ,  Better user interface features like being able to view the desktop with one mouse gesture to the bottom right of the screen .
20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     LEAST useful features of Windows 7 to me :
21                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 They're features I don't use .
22                                                                                                        Windows 7 Ultimate is there too off course, but I personally can't bring myself to spend that much more money just to get a tiny few features that I know I will never use like multi, language support and BitLocker .
23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             It's loaded with useful features .
24                                                                                                                                                                                                                 It has some features that I personally don't find useful, BUT if in the future I do need them, they're there .
25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  There are many features that allow me to personalize my working environment .

27   Personally I thought Vista was very handsome, what with its transparency, 3, D effects, color schemes, and usability improvements to Windows Explorer, and I believe Windows 7 continues that trend by looking just as sexy , ,  if not more , ,  while at the same time adding its own valuable features and enhancements .
28                                                                                                                                                                                                             I haven't yet become accustomed to some features like Aero Shake, but hey, those things are there if I need them .
29                                                                     I can't tell what positives it offers still, but it's still a nifty upgrade with a lot of nifty features over XP that make for a more fun experience for some, and a more organized experience involving navigating huge catacombs of archives and files .

31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0 out of 5 stars XP speed & stability, Vista, like features without the headaches !
32                                                                                                                                                                                               I really wanted to like Vista with all it's cool new features, but unfortunately it was a disaster because it just didn't work .
33                                                                                                                                                                                                                           And I love all the new Aero Shake Peek Snap windows features, but I still prefer Mac OS X's Expose .

35                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ,  Many features are copied from Mac OS X
36                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Of course there are some new features, and a little more eye candy if that's important to you too .
37                                                                                                                                                                  Nice upgrade and love some of the new features, snip tool, sticky's on the desktop, Docking on the task bar and thanks for clearing the clutter on the Tray .
38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     W7 has some cool features that I like, and I'm sure I don't even know the half of it yet .
39                                                                                                                                                                                               I don't have a TV Tuner, so I can't take advantage of that feature, but there are other features & it seems to be working good .
40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       00 dollars just to upgrade for some fancy new features .
41                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Since my Google Sidebar had some features that I liked, it allowed me to replace it for the Windows one .
42                                                                                                                                                                                               Because others on this site have already described in sufficient detail all the amazing features of W7, I will not repeat them .
43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             There are so many more features of this that are very difficult to list all here .
44                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         All   of these features have worked 100% of the time, which is previously unheard of .
45                                                                                                                              Removing a  feature  from the Programs and Features panel simply disables access to it, but the underlying program files associated with that feature remain on the hard, drive taking up space .
46                                                                                                                                                          I also noticed improved power management, including once of my favorite features which is the auto dimming of my laptop monitors once my computer is not being used .
47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   All the features of Vista, but without any of the problems .
48                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It still works pretty good though, just a lack of some features that i had before .
49                                                                                                                                                                                                                            What I will highlight are a few features of Windows 7 which I have been thoroughly impressed with .
50                                                                                                                      Perhaps my expectations were low, since Microsoft OSes tend usually to be just functional   without much pizazz or many  power user  shortcuts and features, but Windows 7 really is a well, crafted OS .
51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I do not use most of the features, such as gaming, that seem to benefit most from the upgrade .
52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Does the new operating system have cool features ?
53                                                                                                                              My only complaint would be that I would like to have a family pack available in the Windows Professional flavor or at least the option to purchase some of the professional features separately .
54                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Seems like they actually stepped it down when it should have been stepped up with more features .
55                                                                                                                                                                I think the reason it didn't is because it wants to force the user to use the Windows Live toolbar that includes other features similar to what Google offers .
56                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Smooth OS with great little features .
57                                                                                                                                                                                         A lot of the new finder desktop windows features are awkward working versions of what Mac OS X has had for a couple of years or more .
58                                                                                                    If you didn't come over from the bright side you would probably think these features are very cool, so enjoy them for what they are if you've never played around with a Mac enough to be comfortable in that environment .

29                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Being able to change your font size is really nice as well, but I keep mine at the lowest so I don't have to turn pages so often .

33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         As I get sleepier, I like to enlarge the font, which is a nice feature .

37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The print appears faded especially with the smaller font sizes .

54                                                                                                                                                                                                 Everyone looking into the Kindle has probably heard about the font smoothing contrast issue which is exacerbated by the bright whiteness of the unit's housing .
55                                                                                                            However, just last night, I ran across a couple of user fixes for the font smoothing problem, and I've already put a  skin  on mine so that the contrast between the ePaper display's gray background and the  frame's  white is no longer an issue .
56                                                                                                                                                                                                      I have a bit of macular degeneration, and when reading the Kindle, for some reason, that little blurry spot does not show up, and this is at a small font .
57                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The Kindle 2 is lightweight, easy to hold, easy to read, and I love the fact that I can change the size of the font, depending on my situation .
58                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I am in my 50's and the reading vision isn't great so changing the font is a blessing .

61                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         it's just like reading a paper book, but BETTER because you can increase the font size !

21                                                                                                                                                                                               There were Italian, Indian, British, American fast food, and Thai restaurants very close to the hotel on Cromwell   Gloucester Rds .
22                                                                                                                                                       Room service is expensive but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a £6 .
23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           You could buy food from Sainsburys or Waitrose which were 2 minutes away to save money .
24                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Food Drink a little pricey in local establishments .
25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  95 if you want hot food as well .
26                                                                                                                                                                                                                Note that all around the hotel are decent little cafes and shops to get either full breakfasts or breakfast foods .
27                                                                                                                                                                                                        We ate on evening once at the Garfunkels pub in the mall, it was typical chain restaurant food but fast with good service .
28                                                                                                                                                                                              There was an adequate self service buffet, not a huge selection or very well presented, cloths were not changed when food got spilt .
29                                                                                                                                                                             Not exactly what most tourists are looking for but when you have been out of the states as long as we have you eat fast food when you get the chance !
30                                                                                                                                                                                                                  There is no mini, fridge in standard rooms, so you can't store any food ,  the hotel used to have mini, fridges .
31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Poor customer service, bad and overpriced pub food .
32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               There is a grocery store close by that you can pick up food and a Starbucks nearby .
33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         As mentioned, there are several places to buy food if you're going cheap :
34                                                                                                                                                                     The hotel is just a couple of minutes walk from the nearest tube station and also has a Waitrose , Tesco and various Fast Food joints and restaurants nearby .
35                                                                                                                                  Shame that we had to use the forum restaurant this morning prior to check out ,  this restaurant is on the first floor and is one of the buffet style breakfasts so lukewarm food and very busy .
36                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The food is very, very good   and the staff were very friendly .
37                                                                                                                The hotel itself was very pleasant ,  the staff friendly and helpful and I can only comment on the breakfasts as this was the only meal that we had there ,  the food was excellent with a wide variety of choice .
38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The food was excellent, the service was very friendly and the prices cheap .
39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The food is excellent and the service great .
40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The bar food actually looked pretty inviting as it passed by .
41                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 If you like Indian food we ate at the Dehli Brassiere it was exellent and more reasonably priced .
42                                                                                                                                                                                               I would recommendeating out as the evening food is frozen re, heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it .
43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 You can buy drinks and breakfast food at a Waitrose supermarket and Tesso express mart next door .
44                                                                                                                                                                                                The area has a few pubs, a couple of steak places, a number of Indian restaurants and some fast food, so it's convenient for that .
45                                                                 Within 200 yards of leaving the hotel and heading to the Tube Station   you have a number of fast food outlets, highstreet Restautants, Pastry shops and supermarkets, so if you did wish to live in your hotel room for the duration of your stay, you could do !
46                                                                                                                                                                                                                as for the continental breakfast taste was good but became boring after the 3rd day the food served wasnt changed .
47                                                                                                                                                                                        We ate in the bistro downstairs and the food was very good ,  although the portions varied significantly depending on the chef that night .
48    The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .
49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    When the food arrive   it was the wrong order .
50                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I can also tell you that there is nothing fantastic about the food .

54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The area is really safe with great food, boots, tesco, waitrose   burger king, kfc and starbucks .

56                                                                                                                                                                                                                            00, good quality food, lots of choice, continental, full english, hot and fresh, very friendly staffs .

59                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The bed was very comfortable, and the empty refrigerator was a great place to store food and beverages .
60                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Within easy reach you have all you could want peaceful areas and shops and food outlets .

62                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Avoid the food in the hotel restaurant as it is ridiculously overpriced .
63                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Also there is a nice bistro around the corner with very good food that is moderately priced .
64                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The food here is great, we had breakfast brought to our room, although pricy well worth it .
65                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Minimall with Boots pharmacy, Whole Foods type ritzy fullservice market, coffee shops, etc .
66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Would not recommend the Patisserie food looked overpriced, pastries were dry !
67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Food is overpriced everywhere due to $ to pound conversion of course .
68                                                                                                                                      there are a variety of priced places to eat in the immediate area, but the food costs are always high,  we ate mostly at pubs, where the beer and scotch were very reasonably priced always !
69                                                                                                                                                                                            More than enough food choices with coffee or tea, juice, pastries, toast, yogurt, cereal and assorted cold cuts to please every taste .
70                                                                                                                                                                                                             Another good thing is that the rooms have mini, fridges and it's great for storing ready, to, eat food from Waitrose .
71                                                                                                                                                                                 they mark down their food at the end of the day and you can get great deals on everything from sandwhiches to desserts at a fraction of the cost .
72                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The food in the restaurant is terrible .
73                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Both of these offer good variety of good food at very reasonable prices and suitable for children .
74                                                                                                                                                                                                     The Glouster Road tube station is just two minutes away, along with other food stores, pubs, internet cafes, restaurants etc .
75                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Its a chain but the food was cheap and delicious !

78                                                                                                                                              If you're a family vacation traveller, you'll probably make use of the grocery store often becuse food in London is expensive when you consider the terrible USD, GPB exchange rate .
79                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Many restaurants in the neighborhood, ranging from swanky to fast food to haute cuisine .

12                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 So if you move around bottles in the fridge so that you can store your own food personal items, the sensor will send a signal to the hotel and you will be charged .
13                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     We passed on the restaurants simply because the cost of breakfast was insane and the food tends to be mediocre .

16                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Room service food quality was very good but with a $7 tray charge plus 20% service, I then absolutely refuse to tip for delivery .
17                                                                                                                                                                                                                         there is a market one block south of the Hyatt that has wine beer and food for reasonable prices until 2am, and a Dominick's   grocery store across the river open til 1am .
18                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Had an appetizer at the Lobby Lounge, and the food came from the Palm Restaurant .
19                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The hotel buffet had fabulous food .
20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I didn't dine in the hotel, so I can't tell you about the food .

67                                                                                                                                                                                      The nightly free wine reception is a great way to meet people and find out what is worth seeing and what is not .

70                                                                                                                                                   The staff were friendly and the free coffee and biscoti each morning and wine at 6pm each evening were occassions when one could meet other guests .
71                                                                                                                                                                                                      The hotel provides free hot drinks and biscotti in the mornings, which was good quality but why ?
72                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Free wine and mingle from 5 to 6pm .
73                                                                                                                                                                                                          It really does save if you can get a deal with free parking, but the fee is not out of line .
74                                                                                                                                                                                   There was a free wine tasting that the hotel put on that we were, unfortunately, too jet, lagged to participate in .
75                                                                                                                                                                    Every evening 5pm to 6pm, guests are invited to have free wine in the reception area and there is free coffee there every morning .
76    The hotel's evening wine hour and morning's biscotti hour also distinguish the property as a cut above, and our group, which has stayed at many a biz hotel, had no problem whatsoever  in fact, a courtesy upgrade got us a fine meeting space with free internet, which even impressed our boss .
77                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The great thing for us was the free parking .
78                                                                                                                                                           We stayed at the BW Tuscan Inn only because they were offering a great winter deal , $99 for a room with king, size bed and free parking   .
79                                                                                                                                                                               Overall, we would recommend this place to friends, especially if they are able to get a good discount and free parking .

83                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        but it's great to get a couple of free drinks .

94                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Free coffee in the lobby in the mornings is nice .
95                                                                                                                                                                                           The free wine in the lounge each evening was very nice, and given with good grace ,  even the fourth glass !
96                                                                                                                                                                          Coffee and hot chocolate were also available free from 6am each morning, although there was also a coffee maker in the room .
97                                                                                                                                                            The only criticism I have is that there was no safe in the room, although safety deposit boxes were available free of charge in reception .
98                                                                                                                        The rest of the immediate neighborhood seemed safe and nondescript, and largely free of the homeless and the street people that are in evidence elsewhere in this costly city .

72   I purchased this camry, three weeks ago, acceleration is a major problem, just not like the older models of camry, was in a accident, hit on the front right side, right fender, car was considered total loss, not fixable, I would not purchase another camry disappointed is this 2007 camry, gas mileage is not as good as prior years, i had to purchase another vehicle, it was not a camry, made in ky, it was a solid 2007 toyota RAV4 made in japan .

21                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The car also does not allow fresh air through the vents  if the AC isn't on, the interior becomes very warm, very quickly .
22                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Looks are great and interior is comfortable, but it ?
23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Even the interior has not held up along with the awful wind noise at highway speeds .
24                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The controls were installed without a problem no cutting of interior plastic, the knee airbag was bypassed .
25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Interior looks OK but is built a little cheap .
26                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The interior is so very quiet, you must compare this car to a Cadillac .
27                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The interior is very luxurious and comfortable, however the car feels slower than my 2002 Camry LE .
28                                                                                                                                                                                     I like the looks and interior but as described in some of the other reviews it has a hesitation problem when you slow down or brake, and then get back on the throttle .
29                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Also, the sound system is so poor unless you are willing to spend $3K more to get the JBL and leather interior, which come together .
30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Interior quality is very poor .
31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Fit and finish are exquisite, the interior is extremely well designed, looks good, fun to drive .
32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Sound system is excellent and interior was adequate but the room is awesome !
33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The interior feels that of a Lexus or BMW and the exterior is an eye catcher .
34                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I love its Avalon like roomy interior and great looks .
35                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I love the interior lighting .
36                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The exterior and interior are nice .
37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Like the looks and styling, both interior and exterior .
38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Interior exterior quality is very good .
39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                3 It is a good interior and exterior design and should be copied by other car makers, but the MPG for the 2 .
40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Very low interior noise level, which adds to the long trip comfort .
41                                                                                                                                          The styling does not say  Camry  anymore and the interior is mostly excellent ,  door handles are too hard and plasticky, some rattles especially when cold outside, not overly fond of the center console design .
42                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The Camry has a ton of style and lots of interior room without being to bulky on the outside .
43                                                                                                                                                                                                           It serves the purpose in which I bought it, and I really do like the roomy interior and the new styling, but there really is no fun factor to it .

55    Examples include fit and finish  had to have the drivers door realigned due to metal, to, metal contact causing terrible rattling  , poor fit of interior parts, which causes a lot of rattling, especially when it's cold out  the auto tranny has a history of serious problems and acts weird, and lastly the paint quality, which chips very easily .

73                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The sunroof actually comes down and slides between the exterior and interior thus minmizing wind noise at speed .
74                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The leather interior is worth the money .
75                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Luxurious interior, great MP3 player addition .
76                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The interior is fairly pleasant but suffers from too much hard plastic and some poor fits !
77                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The interior is very quiet at highway speeds .
78                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The cloth interior is great and the 4 cylinder has tons of power for such a small engine .
79                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     On top of that some interior trim pieces didn't match and one fell off !
80                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Smooth and responsive interior is as luxurious as you can get without slapping an L on the grill .
81                                                                                                                                                                                 The first one was returned to the dealer, on the day of delivery, because of excessive rattling noises coming from the interior, especially the back right side of the car .
82                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The ride is refined, steering is tight, plenty of interior space, the exterior design is refreshing to look at .
83                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          My only complaint with the interior is the color of the fake wood :
84                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The interior is much more comfortable than my last 3 Camrys and the exterior styling is oh so chic .
85                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       IMHO, the exterior and performance are way better than other trims, though you can't compare interior of SE with XLE .
86                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Interior is extremely quiet on the hiway .
87                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Love the looks, power, roomy interior, good mileage at 32 hwy and 25 city .
88                                                                                                                                                                                                           Interior still has too much hard plastic, especially the steering wheel, which has a raised crease hitting on the fingers as a constant reminder .
89                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        It has nice luxury interior  , but it also has nice pick up speed and is very roomy .
90                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I like the wood grain accents with the tan colored interior   but I don't think is looks as good with the gray interior .
91                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Excellent interior build quality .
92                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The new interior design is ok to me, the blue, backgound center console is a little bit awkward, too bright at night .
93                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Ash leather interior with light yellow fake wood trim is just ok design .
94                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Leather interior very comfortable .
95                                                                                                                                                    The interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields greater comfort .
96                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nice looking interior but seats are very hard and are not comfortable for long trips .
97                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               There are so many interior improvements and well as engineering improvements .

7                                                       The light weight, the battery life, the keyboard, the non, protruding removable battery, the bright screen, the track pad disable button and general ease of use makes it hard to beat .

15                                                           The keyboard is not quite perfect, the screen doesn't tilt back as far as I'd like, slightly higher resolution in the screen would be nice a new model not yet available in the U .

19                                                                                                                                               The keyboard is REALLY easy to get used to, possibly the best netbook keyboard I've ever used .
20                                                                                                                                                             It was easy to set up, and I really liked the comfort of the mouse and keyboard .
21                                              The machine has the most comfortable small keyboard I've ever used, because the keys are flat and so the surfaces that your fingerpads touch are actually about the size of standard keyboards .
22                                                                                                                                                                         The keyboard and mouse are my biggest concern for the tiny computer .

28                                                                                                                                                                     The only comparable keyboards I found were those on much larger laptops .
29                                                                                                                                                                                                          My keyboard also seems a bit noisy .
30                                                                                                                                                                         However, two weeks in, the keyboard would sporadically stop working .
31                                                                                                                       The build quality is very good, and the keyboard, though small, is surprisingly comfortable and has good key response .
32                                                                                                                                                          The keyboard is generous for a netbook, but I still have some trouble typing on it .
33                                                                                                                                                 They keyboard takes some getting used to, but even still, I could not write a novel on this .
34                                                                                                                                                                                       Keyboard feels funny at first, but you get used to it .
35                                                                                                                                                                 The keyboard isn't quite full sized of course, but very easy to get used to .
36                                   I have briefly tried typing on a number of netbooks since last fall, and this is the only one that had a decent keyboard just big enough to accommodate my hands and not result in multiple typing errors .
37                                                                                                                                         I have large hands and with a little time on the keyboard I'm breezing through word processing jobs .
38                                                                                                                                        I found the ASUS keyboard comfortable to type quickly  it is touch, typeable after brief acclimation .
39                                                                                                                                                                             The keyboard, more than 90% standard size, is just large enough .
40                                                                                                                                                                I picked it up right away due to the battery life, keyboard and sleek design .
41                                                                                                       With such a great battery life, keyboard and responsive touch pad, there's really no other model that can hold a candle to this puppy .
42                                                                                                                                      I think the most important thing on these small netbooks is the keyboard, and this one feels very good .
43                                                                                                      I notice the tighter keyboard spacing, but it seems easy to type on, yielding no more typing errors than my bad typing normally yields .
44                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,  keyboard feels well laid out
45                                                                                                      The keyboard is easy to type on  , the battery life is great, and I've found that I really do like the touch pad with all its features .
46                                                                                                   Speaking of which, the keyboard's relatively large size ,  at 92% of the size of a normal one ,  writing longer texts on it is no problem .
47                                                                                                                           While I still like the keyboard style of the Toshiba better, the EEE PC has some features that are pretty awesome !
48                                                                                                                                                                                     The keyboard doesn't have separation between the keys   .
49                                                                                                                                                            I also noticed within the second or third day of use that the keyboard was loose .
50                                                                                                                    I found if I pushed down and slid upward in the upper left corner, the keyboard moved up slightly and clicked into place .
51                                                                                                                                                           It did not seem to affect the use of the keyboard but it was a slight distraction .
52                                                                                                                                                                     The most noticeable difference is the screen and keyboard functionality .
53                                                                                                                                                       The cover and screen are glossy and it has a 92% keyboard which is plenty comfortable .
54                                                                                                                                                                                 Speaking of typing, the keyboard is great, almost full size .
55                                                                                                                                                                                                            The keyboard really works for me .
56                                                                                                            It is smaller than a standard keyboard, but after a day or two I got used to it and now I can type pretty fast with few mistakes .
57                                                                                                                       I also needed Web connectivity for research, a screen with a low squint factor and a keyboard that wasn't too cramped .
58                                                                                                                                 I goosed up the memory to 2G and stuffed a 8G SD memory board in the slot on the right side of the keyboard .
59                                                                                                                                                                    The keyboard is just fine for my bony fingers & cruise, on writing speed .
60                                                                     And it goes in that bag wrapped in the white paper plastic bag it was originally boxed up in, with another piece of packing plastic between the keyboard and the screen .
61                                                                                                                                                                                               1 The keyboard takes a bit of getting used to .
62                                                                                                            It's 92% the size of a regular keyboard, and my somewhat larger, than, average male hands have adapted completely in a few weeks .
63                                                                                                                                                                                                Small keyboard with some double, function keys
64                                                                                                                                                                                          The keyboard is also combortable and not too small .
65                                                                                    It is a bit of a pain to unplug and replug power, monitor, LAN, wireless mouse keyboard, hard drive back, up and PDA cable, but not the end of the world .
66                                                                           4 And finally the keyboard doesn't stay fastened down at the top it would seem like an easy fix, I've noted it for repair twice and I still have the same problem .
67                                                                                                                       1 keyboard still floats  2the screen goes to a solid blue screen either right after starting or after it sits a while .
68                                                                                                                                     Great battery life, decent sized screen, and the keyboard was large enough to be comfortable to type on .
69                                                                                                                                                                                      Controls for these functions are right on the keyboard .
70                                                                                                                                    The keyboard is very useable, I type on it as well as any desktop keyboard this was a must, have feature .
71                                                                                                                                         The ASUS is comfortable ,  the keyboard is normal sized, so I don't make any adjustment when typing .
72                                                                                                                                                The keyboard took about 20 minutes to get used to, but i'm now typing on it very comfortably .

75                                                                                                                                       This was actually the one of the things I feared most, but turns out the keyboard is set up real nice .

105                                                                                                                         The keyboard feel is good but the touchpad is hard and being small I get confused with the side scroll area easily .
106                                                                                                                                                                                            The keyboard is great and the screen looks good .

108                                                                                                                              Productivity wasn't a huge benefit, but I did feel the keyboard was a major selling point for the extra dough .
109                                                                                                                                             I have more productivity  flow  on a conventional laptop with a full sized screen and keyboard .
110                                                                                                                                                           I was afraid I wouldn't like the small keyboard, but it's really easy to type on .
111                                                                                                                                                                                                              Excellent keyboard for typing .

113                                                                                                                                                                                     The keyboard and buttons felt good for a small netbook .
114                                                                                                                                                                                       The keyboard is smallish, but not ridiculously small .
115                                                                                                                                                                       The keyboard is surprisingly good for someone like me with big hands .
116                                                                                                                                                No keyboard issues on any of them, no running hot, although the adapters do get really warm .

120                                                                                                                                             The keyboard is awesome since it looks like regular one with a large backspace, and two shifts .
121                                                                                                                                                                                             I like the zoom in out feature on the keyboard !
122                                                                                                                                                         The keyboard is only slightly smaller than a regular one, so it's very comfortable .
123                                                                 I mostly find that when I make typos, it's not because of the keyboard, it's because of the smallness of the screen, , I just can't see what I'm doing as well as a laptop .
124                                                   A lot of netbooks on the market have mangled the keyboard in one way or another such that if you are a touch typist, you find yourself hitting the wrong key often, which is frustrating ."

43   00, however that being said if you are used to staying at true Kimpton hotels this will leave you wanting, but again location and price makes this a great hotel, the wine they serve is 2 buck chuck get there early if you want to partake, there were people everywhere waiting for the pourings, so we decided to skip out on this one

90                                                                                                                                            Location of the hotel was ideal to explore the know attractions, with just a 2 min walk to the wharf   ferries and the famous cable cars, which transported you to union square  lombard st etc .
91                                                                                                                                                   The location is ideal but the car park is really expensive, so if you are ending a trip here, take your hire car back after you have unloaded your luggage and get a taxi to the airport .

94                                                                                                                                                                                                     We have now stayed in three hotels in Fisherman's Wharf but the Tuscan Inn represents a good comprise of location, cost and facilities .

140                      This was my 9th trip to San Francisco but unlike prior trips I was with my in, laws and had different criteria for the trip, they wanted to be close to all the Fishermans Wharf action and walking distance to the main tourist attractions, this hotel was ideal and the best value we could find in the location .
141                                                                                                                                                                                                                        very good hotel ,  great location, concierge extremely helpful, decor is nice and the maid service was excellent   .
142                                                                                                                                                                                                The location is great, 2 blocks from FW and 5, 6 blocks from really good italian food in North Beach and Chinatown is in that area as well .
143                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             We loved the location as it was convenient to everything and a short walk to many attractions .

213                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Great location but don't bring the car !
214                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The location is great however, only 5 mins walk from the Gloucester Road tube and 10 mins walk to the South Kensington museums, Albert Hall, etc .

11                                                                                                                                                                 Leased in Feb 2008 as a replacement to a Pilot, which had poor gas mileage .
12                                                                                                                                 I do miss the carry and load capacity of the Pilot, but the Accord gets decent gas mileage by comparison   .
13                                                                                                                                                                                My old Buicks had far smoother shifts at far higher mileage .

16                                                                                                                                                                 Gas mileage is only 20 around town and 26 to 27 on the highway with a four !

20                                                                                                                                                                           I wanted an inexpensive car with good mileage, and strong resale .
21                                                                                                                                                          Very good mileage, getting about 28 mpg combined highway, and I have a heavy foot .
22                                                                                                                                              The 190 hp I4 engine is powerful and smooth enough to enjoy, without sacrificing fuel mileage .
23                                                                                                                                                                                               great mileage, poor build quality of the car .
24                                                                                                                                                           On top of all this, I get horrible gas mileage  in city driving I get 15, 16 mpg .
25                                                                                                                                                                                                 It gets great gas mileage and love the car .

27                                                                                                                                                                                              3 mpg as consistent full tank highway mileage .
28                                                                                                                                                                The car drives great and gets better gas mileage than my 2000 Lincoln LS V8 .
29                                                                                                                                                                                    It looks great, handles well, and gets good gas mileage .
30                                                                                                                                                                   The gas mileage has improved from 18MPG to 21 but that still is not good .
31                                                                                                                                                                        Gas mileage has been a bit disappointing, but it has been improving .
32                                                                                                                                        the variable cylinder management changes to 4 cyl when not under load, this helps with fuel mileage .
33                                                                                                                                               After owning a Honda Accord EX   I had to go back to the Honda the gas mileage can't be beat .
34                                                                                                                                                                             Gas mileage is around 22, 23 in town and 29, 30 on the highway .
35                                                                                                                                                                                                   Fuel mileage has been less than expected .
36                                                                                                                                                     It's no 8 cylinder GT, but it also gets double the gas mileage and so far, no problems .
37                                                                                                                              Aside from missing the turbo's acceleration, I've preferred the Accord's better mileage, handling and comfort .
38                                                                                                                                                          The manual transmission lets me control the car better and achieve higher mileage .
39                                                                                                                                                  So beware, if you are trading in your V8 for a mileage vehicle, this is not it in my case .
40                                                                                                                                                     The car is getting great gas mileage   even though I have only been driving it 2 weeks .
41                                                                                                                                                                           Our 2008 Accord is very disappointing, our in town mileage is 14 .
42                                                                                                                                                                Gets great gas mileage, I mostly drive city and I am currently receiving 25 .
43                                                                                                                                                                                       I just love the VCM makes the car give great mileage .
44                                                                                                                                                                                                         Initial gas mileage looks good too .

46                                                                                                  I have a V, 6 with Variable Cylinder Management which is supposed to let the car run on 3,4 or 6 cylinders, as needed, to improve mileage .
47                                                                                                                                                                                                             My BMW 530i got better mileage .
48                                                                                                   It is fun to drive, I love the color, it has great features, the sound system is nice, the power is perfect and the gas mileage is great !
49                                                                                                                                           Fun to drive, fairly roomy, looks good, gas mileage is OK  , but not as good as Honda advertises .
50                                                                                                                                                                     Gas mileage is wonderful, 1st tank 26 mpg with almost all city driving .
51                                                                                                                             I had tons of room in my 4Runner, but I needed something that would get better gas mileage w o giving up power .
52                                                                                                                                                                                             I am so very disappointed with the gas mileage !
53                                                                                                                                                                                        I traded for better mileage, and this is what I got .
54                                                                                                                                          I will warn you though, that if you drive it like it should be driven, gas mileage isn't the best .
55                                                                                                                                                     It feels safe, performs well, looks fantastic and gets decent gas mileage for its size .
56                                                                                                                                                                   The Accord is better than other those car on gas mileage and reliability .
57                                                                                                                                                                   Strangely, the gas mileage is not as good as the Acura but is acceptable .
58                                                                                                                                                                                          Some reviewers were complaining about gas mileage .
59                                                                                                                                                                          Gas mileage is horrible too, 20 mpg city highway after 6000 miles .
60                                                                                                                                       If you are looking for a car that is affordable and well built this is the car for you bad gas mileage
61                                                                                                                                        In reality we have been very disappointed our in city mileage is 16, 17 and highway is better at 27 .
62                                                                                                                         While the mileage is not bad it good be better, but as the acceleration is good for a 4 cylinder it's a trade, off .
63                                                                                                                                      I am sure as gas prices go up cars will be built to get better mileage at the expense of acceleration .
64                                                                                                                                     Good looking inside and out, comfortable and roomy, commendable performance, and excellent gas mileage .
65                                                                                                                                       I live in Chicago and drive downtown and back 2 times a week for school and am getting great mileage .
66                                                                                                                                                        Only update is after about 5k miles the fuel mileage is less than I had anticipated .
67                                                                                                               Everything else such gas mileage, handling, stereo system is fine but it doesn't make up for the loud rattles and wind noise .
68                                                                                                                         It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater .
69                                                                                                                             So I saved $2 K upfront and will also save down the road since the 4 cylinder gets slightly better gas mileage .
70                                                                                                                                                                         It is a well built car that runs smooth and gets great gas mileage .
71                                                                                                                                                                                                 Gas mileage is still getting better though .
72                                                                                                                                                                           The gas mileage on the highway is about the same for both models .
73                                                                                                                                        Local mileage with the '08 has been about 24 mpg, and about 25 mpg with the '06's that we've leased .
74                                                                                                                                                              I decided to go back to Honda as even with high mileage they keep their value .
75                                                                                                                          Mileage ,  also not impressive ,  all I can get is about 24mpg, far from the 32 mpg you see on the window sticker .
76                                                                                                                                                                           Posted mileage ratings are for those who have a heavy right foot .
77                                                                                                                                                            Gas mileage is fantastic especially going from a V8 SUV to a 4 cylinder sedan   .
78            I was tempted to go for the V6, but I drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas mileage Honda claims .
79                                                                       I just love this car ,  and with almost double the highway gas mileage that I was getting with my Grand Cherokee ,  that adds a lot of $$ towards my monthly payment .
80                                                                                                                                                                                                            190 hp and superior gas mileage .
81                                                                                                                                                                 It wasn't worth saving the little difference in gas mileage for this Honda .
82                                                                                                                   The gas mileage is about 45 to the gallon going on the highway with cruise at about 800 or 900 RPM and about 38 going 70 .
83                                                                                                                                                  The Gas mileage is good, the acceleration sometime is slow when cold from 1st to 2nd gear .
84                                                                                                                                                                                     I hope to get better mileage on extended highway trips .
85                                                                                                          I think the mileage would be even better with a 6, speed stick shift to drop the tachometer from ~2300 rpm to <2000 rpm at 60 mph .
86                                                                                                                                                                      Gas mileage has been improving and is now consistently 29 hwy 22 city .
87                                                                                                                                                                                       Very peppy engine great fuel mileage 28, 30 combined .
88                                                                                                                                                                            I am not known to drive slowly so I am pleased with the mileage .
89                                                                                                         We bought this car with the expectations of getting a car that feels good with my bad back, gets good gas mileage, and is reliable .

105                                                 The 4,  door provides the room we needed, the exterior design keeps the  sedan  from looking boring, the gas mileage is great, the price point was right, and the reliability is terrific .

118                                                                                                                                                                There seems to be no way to shut it off and mileage is about 26 27 highway .
119                                                                                                                                                                                    Mileage jumps on the highway to 31 32 at normal speeds .

121                                                                                                                                                              Around town gas mileage is not as good at 22 with a mix of city and high way .

123                                                      Some here have complained of poor gas mileage, but I've had mine almost two weeks, driven 300 miles so far in mostly city driving, and have a bit more than a quarter of a tank left .
124                                                                         5L V6 scoots  sporty handling and acceleration good  sporty leather seats  highway gas mileage  appearance package worth having  no dealer service yet  Negatives :

131               I love the appearance of the car from the outside, and it has a much bigger feel to it, ride is a little stiff but smooth, engine is very responsive, however gas mileage is diappointing getting 5 mpg less then 06 Accord .
132                                                                                                                                                                  My only really complaint is the gas mileage is not as good as advertised .

14                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Amazon claim's it's only 20% faster, but it FEELS almost twice as fast ,  and the menus are much better organized and easier to navigate .

27                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           This is a beautiful little product  it feels sleek and sturdy and   booklike in my hands, the controls are finally where they ought to be and the navigation interface is intuitive and easy to learn .
28                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     As advertised, it is very easy on the eyes, combined with font sizing and easy navigation this does what it was meant to do .
29                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Some PDFs' tables of contents DID work as a navigable set of links .
30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    For typing and navigating, the e, ink technology takes patience and a little getting used to , ,  especially for frenetic folks in task mode .
31   1 the ink takes a moment to display on the screen after your input from the keyboard or navigation contoller  2 the keyboard input is stiff and requires a direct punch on the very tiny keys to register  3 the keyboard is so close to the bottom of the unit, and the Kindle is so flexible, typing is something of a laborious or even tortured action for relatively short notes such as this paragraph actually written on the Kindle 2 .
32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Navigation is much easier with the 5, way button .
33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                There can be occassional minor  ghosting  problems where the screen does not completely update on a page turn or when navigating .
34                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I realize the K1 did not have this either, but it sure would be easier to touch the places you want to navigate than use the joystick .
35                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Instead, it displays the book title and there is no way to navigate to the last page read .
36                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The fastest way to navigate through a larger work   would be to leave your page, go to the table of contents and choose the most likely chapter and then proceed page by page from there till you reach your desired page .
37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  As mentioned above, the free copies also do not have active table of contents, so navigation is well near impossible beyond simply ploughing through form start to finish, which is what I did .
38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Again navigation is by using the next and previous page buttons .
39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I think in most areas the Kindle 2 has met expectations, but a sluggish cursor, poor navigation and almost non, existent capability to organize content are major drawbacks .
40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The largest difference was the touch screen at the bottom, but once you're doing the primary thing that e, readers do   it becomes a non, issue, as it's only for navigation .
41                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      It's actually slightly more awkward to navigate using the touch screen because you have to look between both screens, whereas with the Kindle you just use the directional rocker in the planned direction .
42                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The Kindle is really fun to use and I'm having a blast learning to navigate it and how to use all its features .
43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I find navigating the device page turns, menus, etc .
44                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I also found using the navigation button difficult .
45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I have some more to learn about searching and navigating, but if an old geezer like me can do it, anybody can .
46                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   >> Far better navigation between articles in periodicals, and easier navigation overall with its five, way controller replacing the K1's clumsy and time, consuming navigation wheel and cursor

12                                                                                                                                                                                                               I found a great mid week deal that included a discount on parking .
13                                                                                                                                                                                                   On the other hand, the valet parking attendant bell people were very friendly .
14                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Parking is expensive, Rooms are on the small side .
15                                                                                                                                                                                                              However, parking is $30 night and valet only, which becomes a pain .
16                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Only other downer was $38 per night for valet parking .
17                                                                                                                                             room was quiet, clean with good beds but very very smallnot a cheap hotelvalit parking was to much expencive but oke its the location
18                                                                                                                                                                      Parking is crazy expensive, we drove up from LA so we had a car ,  but otherwise, you really don't need it .
19                                                                                                                                                                                                      Parking is expensive   and everything is very much within walking distance .
20                                                                                                                                             Valet parking is, in my view, unreasonably high at $38 per night, but again we knew this before we arrived so can't really complain .
21                                                                                                                                  As most hotels in the city, parking is expensive so unless you really need a vehicle its cheaper to just buy a MUNI Passport during your stay .
22                                                                                                                                                                                  The hotel does have parking, but it is expensive and hard to get around the city while driving .
23                                                                                                                                                                  The parking was steep  , so if I had to do it again I would have parked 1 2 block north for about half of that .
24                                                                                                                                                                                              Parking at $45 a night was outrageous, but probably worth it to keep your car safe .
25                                                                                                                                                                                                                               We did not have a car, hotel parking is expensive .
26                                                                                                                                                                                          The valet parking was very convenient and seemed secure as it is attached to the hotel .
27                                                                                                                                                                                       A lot of hotel parking garages lots are not on the same premises as the hotel in the area .
28                                                                                                                                                                                                            First, the biggest &quot gotcha&quot  is the mandatory valet parking .
29                                                                                                                               Not trying to bad mouth the Tuscan, it is a nice place to stay, and if you're not put off by the valet parking, you shouldn't be too disappointed .
30                                                                                                                                                                              Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .
31                                                                                                                                                                          The prize for vallet parking is steep but I think you can expect that anywhere you go in San Francisco .
32                                                                                                                                                     Valet parking was $45 per night with tax, but that includes in and out privileges and my car was there whenever I needed it .
33                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Watch out for steep parking rates of about $45 per night .
34                                                                                                                                                                                                              This total includes the taxes and tips for mandatory valet parking .
35                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Aside from the parking rate, you won't be disappointed .
36                                                                           The other thing that I found disappointing was I can't remember the exact details but something like the charge they quote for parking   was even more than that because there was some sort of a tax .
37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Onsite parking is available .
38                                                                                                                                                                             I called before we ever arrived to inquire about it and was told that parking was no problem at all .
39                                                                                              I guess calling to inquire about parking while giving them our name and reservation dates didn't warrant the clerk to inform us that we should make a reservation for our car also .
40                                                                                                                                                                                                            Valet parking is provided at $36 day which was, I thought, excessive .
41                                                                                                                                                                Walgreens has same souvenirs the airport shops do for 1 2 $Do not rent a car, waste of time, money,   no parking !
42                                                                                                                                                                                              The valet parking was overpriced, the service was terrible, and the coffe was cold .
43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          At the hotel, it is valet only parking .
44                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Check for Internet deals and don't pay for their parking .
45                                                                                                                                                                                            I do think that if you are staying at a hotel you should not have to pay for parking .
46                                                                                        The hotel, located a few blocks from Fisherman's Wharf as well as Ghiardelli Square, has a nice Italian theme that carries into the lobby as well as the uniforms for the parking valets .
47                                                                                                                     Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .
48                                                                                                     Not only is it pricey at $36 day, but having nothing but valet parking means you have no access to your car unless you have one of the valets fetch it from the lot for you .
49   Although our room was indeed non, smoking   and we had a king size bed we ended up on the 3rd floor and our room, facing Mason Street, overlooked a concrete multi, story parking lot although if you stood at the window you could see the Coit Tower which was a nicer view !

51                                                                                                                                                                                     It really does save if you can get a deal with free parking, but the fee is not out of line .
52                                                                                                                               Valet parking was $36 a day, but we're not complaining because other SF wharf hotels have charged us a similar fee even without the valet service .
53                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Another irritant was the crazy parking fees for the hotel .
54                                                                                                                                                                  They do a good job and are a heck of a lot cheaper than a cab and you wont have to mess with the parking fees .
55                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   When I got a GREAT deal $99 INCLUDING parking !
56                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The great thing for us was the free parking .
57                                                                                                                                                                                                 Normally parking is $36 a night so getting that thrown in was a fantastic steal .
58                                                                                                                                      We stayed at the BW Tuscan Inn only because they were offering a great winter deal , $99 for a room with king, size bed and free parking   .
59                                                                                                                                                          Overall, we would recommend this place to friends, especially if they are able to get a good discount and free parking .
60                                                                                                                                                                                                           Nice rooms, a bit on the smaller side, but parking right at the hotel .
61                                                                                                                                                                                    staff were helpful although the valet parking and the laundry costs were extremely expensive .
62                                                                                                                                                                                                   They allowed this, so we only had to pay the regular parking fee of the hotel .
63                                                                                                                                                                                               Way too much money to pay for parking, but that is the way it is in San Francisco .
64                                                                                                                                                                                                                             You don't need a car because parking is a nightmare .
65                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            all these hotels charge parking fees .
66                                                                                                                                                                  Parking at the hotel is expensive at $32 plus tax per night but the up side is that you have in out privilages .
67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Parking in the city is a royal pain !
68                                                                                                                                                        Although the parking charge is steep, it seems to be the market price in San Francisco, or as the locals like to call it :
69                                                                                                           I notice on other reviews the high cost of parking which we didn't have to consider as we were advised you do not need a car to get around SF, and this is quite true .
70               All in all, the location was perfect ,  a short walk to the cable cars or bus lines, a Safeway grocery and Walgreens drugs is across the street in a parking garage, type mall, and there are small places to eat breakfast nearby plus an IHOP a few blocks over .
71                                                                                                                                                                                               Parking at the hotel was a hefty $32 per day with unlimited in and out privileges .
72                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Parking is an issue in SF so either pay the $30 .
73                                                                                      In addition, the valet parking is apparently handled by an outside contractor, and turned out to be considerably more expensive than we had been told ,  $35 day ,  which seemed very high .
74                                                                                                                                                                          Because of the exhorbitant $29 valet parking fee, we only rented a car for Sonoma and Napa for one day .
75                                                                                                                                                                                  You'll be having fun while some other poor sod is looking for a parking space that isn't there .
76                                                                                                                                                                                         30 am, we discovered that the parking garage next door   would not be open until 7 ,  7 :
77                                                                                                                                                                                          I thought the $29 per day parking was ridiculous, but I hear that's the standard in SF .
78                                                                                                                     Upon arriving, there was a very long and confusing to do with the valet parking ,  we hadn't gotten our luggage out of th car and the valet wanted the keys .
79                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  There was a fee of $29 per day for the parking .
80                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Valet parking attendant was no better .
81                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 paid $161 plus tax along with a $20 parking fee .
82                                                                                                                                                            As far as parking is concerned, we were shell, shocked at what most of the hotels charge for parkingup to $40 night .
83                                                                                                                                                 The Tuscan is $29 night, but if you search for a package rate on their web site, you may get parking included in your room rate .
84                                                                                                                                                                           And, conveniently, there is a Safeway and a drug store hidden in the parking garage across the street .
85                                                                                                                                                          We didnt have or need a car so we didnt have to deal with parking a car I believe it is $30 a day, ,  par for the city .
86                                                                                                                                                                              It is located 2 blocks from the wharf which was outstanding considering parking is hard to come by .

33                                        Overweight ,  3600 pounds, lots of road noise, and the combined performance of the VCM and the grade logic automatic transmission mke this a miserable driver .

11                                                                                                                           The performance is great for it's size ,  remember these are not designed to be speed demons but to be highly portable and cordless for extended periods of time .

15                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I keep a couple of apps running and its performance is great .
16  Amazon seems to be concerned that I am simply  experiencing performance or compatibility problems , , and that my computer thus does not qualify as  defective  by their criteria, , but I would contend that a new computer that cannot be supplied with electricity is a complete lemon .

19                                                                                                                                                                                 Replacing them isn't very hard given a screw and five minutes, and doing so noticeably ups the performance .

25                              This did not affect me much, I can write without problems full university texts, media files run without any problem   and the battery have been used for seven consecutive hours using the computer to the maximum in High Performance Mode without depleted .

2    Before purchasing, I was obsessed with the reviews and predictions I found online and reading about some of the critiques such as the thick border, the lack of touchscreen, lack of battery SD slot, lack of a back light, awkward difficult keyboard layout, minimally faster page flipping, and the super, high price .

17                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I did see a few big price differences eg .
18                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The other drawback for some is the price .
19                                                                                                                                                                                                           Book prices are less than you will find in book stores and may be less than you will find on other e, book sites .
20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Is the K2 so much better than the K1 as to justify the price ?
21                                                                                                                                                                                                                         the BUT comes in and applies to the fact that the price for the downloads has been going up and up .
22                                                                                                                                                                                                 since the cost of the kindle is high anyway, the benefit, other than easy storage, was the reduced price of book downloads .
23                                                                                                                                                                                 The lack of such an obvious and necessary feature, especially considering the price of the device, really degrades its value and usability .
24                                                 I want you to know that ultimately, however, if I want a Kindle I will have to capitulate and accept Amazon's terms because Amazon has a monopoly over their own machine, and I will have to purchase one even at prices I believe are needlessly high for e, book readers .
25                                                                                                                                                                                And I know for sure that many print publishers will see this as an opportunity to provide attractively priced paper books as an alternative .
26                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  At the steep price of this device we should get better quality components .
27                                                                                                                            To have this continuous, high speed, wireless connectivity without the need for a physical computer to upload download onto is truly amazing and makes the price of the Kindle truly irrelevant .
28                                                                                                                                                                                     price  , and intuitive operation your parents and grandparents can operate this device, if you are fortunate enough to still have them !
29                                                                                                                                                                               As a teacher, I really wanted this machine and have been waiting for the price to drop so that I could give myself the excuse to purchase it .
30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Disappointing given the prices .
31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The price for new hardbacks on the Kindle is great too .
32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               After reading the reviews and pondering the price all day, I took the plunge .
33                                                                                                                                                                             The ability to plug in headphones and play Miles Davis to drown out the screaming kid while you are reading at the doctors office is priceless .
34                                                                                                                                                       If you are searching for a REAL review on the Kindle 2 by someone that was waiting to receive it rather than complaining about price or other issues then here it is .
35                          However, I will say, the selection of inexpensive books has been worth the purchase price of this item  especially for those that enjoy reading the classics or nationwide news, it has been a joy to purchase entire collections for a fraction of the cost of purchasing new or even used books .
36                                                                                                                                                                                           Those in college, with children or just have a love of reading will likely find the convenience and savings well worth the price .
37                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I found many simply by doing a search on genre's of interest with price  low to high  as a default .
38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     To justify the purchase price, those functions really need to be there .
39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The price of these 'classic' titles is pretty hard to beat, too .
40                                                                                                                                                                            I was a little miffed when i saw that they would now be charging for the Kindle cover, which was included in the price for the previous version .
41                                                                                                                                                                              Mind you, it's the same size as the Kindle 1, and that of most book pages, but I for one dream of something larger without a larger price tag .
42                                                                                                                                                                                                                 If I have to spend the full puirchase price on the K2 with a K1 still in hand I would have probably waited .
43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Although pricey, the real value of this purchase is that it got me to read again .
44                                                                                                                                                                                        But, as far as my reading experience with the kindle 2, I have downloaded so many books and all at a fraction of the original price .
45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I just hope that the price goes down .
46                                                                                                                                            Yes, it costs extra, but they lowered the price on the Kindle 2 so that buying the basic cover costs plus the purchase price of the device itself equals the cost of a Kindle 1 .
47                                                                                                                                                                         But given my book storage issues and how much it would cost me to rent a bigger apartment here in the City, I didn't mind paying the current price .

51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Should have been priced at $250  .
52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Even if you want to , I think it is way too pricey .
53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The subscription prices and book prices are really good from what my wife tells me .
54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Though it would be nice if the cover was included in the K2 price, it is still worth buying .
55                                                                                                                                                                                                  It is pricey but if you buy as many books as I do, it will pay for itself within a year due to the low cost of most books .
56                                                                                                                                                                                                The price of the device itself is the only drawback but if your an avid reader like myself the reward far outways the price .
57                                                                                                                                                                                                        The price, tag is pretty hefty for most people, though I would counter that the value proposition makes up for it   .
58                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I'm positive that future releases will bring the price point down .
59                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2, Book Selection & price,  I made a list of 20 books .
60                                                                                                                                                                                                       Of the 20, several were priced higher on B&N then amazon, significantly so, while 5 were not available on B&N at all .
61                                                                                                                                                                                            for the price of a few hundred used old, fashioned  paperbacks  and free your shelves for figurines or a nice bottle collection !
62                                                                                                                                                                                                         When the original Kindle was released, I was intrigued, but never researched it due to the insanely high price tag .
63                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     It was obviously out of my price range .
64                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    One, for what you get it is over priced .
65                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Last I would suggest for the price a protective cover should be included with the product .
66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The price, tag for this item is quite steep when you first look at it .
67                                                                                                                                                                                                                I checked the difference in price between the cheapest print available of the books and the Kindle Editions .
68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Turns out some of them were the same price, while others were much cheaper for the Kindle .
69                                                                                                                                                                                                      she thought she wanted one, but was a bit daunted by the price and the question of how much she would actually use it .
70                                                                                                                                                                   I thought about buying an eBook reader for a few months and had thought i would go with the B&N Nook until i compared book prices between B&N and Amazon .
71                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Amazons book are priced significantly lower and easier to find in my opinion .
72                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Ultimately, I end up paying full price and have for many years .
73                                                                                                                                                                        About a month ago after finishing in one weekend and realizing that I paid $28 for it I thought Kindle's cheaper prices and mobility would be great .
74                                                                                                                                                                                                          I can download samples and buy books for $10 so I have a lot of things I would not buy if I had to pay full price .
75                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Books are priced in US$ for oversea consumers .
76                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           99, thus offsetting the high price of the Kindle .
77                                                                                                                                                             Perhaps the misunderstanding was mine, but I find myself once again buying books or borrowing from the Library because of inflated prices for the new releases .

32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I wouldn't say it stands out particularly, but if you're looking for a reliable, convenient, comfortable place in London, this is a great place to stay , ,  especially if you can get it at a good price on Priceline or another site like that .
33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Nothing that spectacular to justify the price .

60                                                                                                                                           Another word of warning when booking through the Holiday Inn website ,  VAT was NOT included in the price at the time of booking until you actually processed the booking and paid for the room ,  this is apparently now normal for many London hotels which I'd never experienced before ,  we ended up paying £17 more per night than I'd expected .

88                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            All in all it was just what we expected based on the price and would stay here again .
89                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Stay here ,  you won't regret it,  great price ,  great location .
90                                                                                                                         The shower pressure was a bit low but that's the price you pay for the top floor and it was well worth it  ,  Instead of minibar there was an empty fridge which came quite handy for our own beverages, I doubt they would have milk in their minibar  ,  Tea and coffee making facilites and iron with board were a great bonus to what we had expected from our room .
91                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The only downsize of this hotel I see in the cost of breakfast, with price of more than £15 for full English breakfast or £10 if booked in advance .

94                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              That's a good price even though the room was tiny, however, when it came to the continental breakfast, the hotel would not permit us to partake of same, telling us that because we reserved through Hotwire, we were ineligible for the breakfast .
95                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Good if you don't pay retail price .
96                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Overall, this hotel is okay if you're on a budget or get a good deal through a discount site, but definitely NOT worth paying retail price for .

102                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I would definately recommed this hotel to anyone as it is unbeatable for price and location in London .
103                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         It was a bargain price for the hotel and it was great  .
104                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                For a similarly good location  , you can stay at the London Hilton Metropole for the same price and receive much better service .

106                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      GREAT location and bargain internet price !
107                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    There is little difference in the price and when we return to London in three weeks I have booked the Millennium in preference to the Forum .
108                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Although this was about the same price as the local bars etc .
109                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 All in all I would definitly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a pleasant stay in London, in a nice area, at a good price !

140  After initial angst of getting a room, after a NY, London flight, I settled for a twin and not a double bedded room, 17th floor , small but very comfortable room, windows do open, bathroom new , staff fine and concierge area knowledgeable and openly interested and helpful, the hotel really tries, dont nit pick small things, dont pay more than $120 max and if you want to at least check out other reliable hotels, there are many shockers at all price ranges, do your research  !

11                                                                                                                                      Mine suffers from the tranny slip   on the 3, 4 upshift when cold, build quality is good but nothing like the Toyota, hype I was expecting, as it has its share of squeaks and rattles just like a 10 year old Chevy .
12                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Overall a good car, no build quality issues yet .
13                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      After owning a 95 Camry, I expected the same quality .

15                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         A lot of defects that I still do not understand how my car passed the quality inspection when it was manufactured .

17                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               JBL radio is low quality cd, fm, and mp3 all sound the same .

20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Initial quality was lacking and it's only getting worse .

22                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               s not worth buying given the quality issues .
23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Seems the company's quest to be #1 has caused quality issues .
24                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Interior quality is very poor .

26                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            This is not the Toyota quality I was expecting .

32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Horrible quality of interior .
33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Some have mentioned disappointing build quality .
34                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            As compared to my wife's 2004 Highlander, my new Camry does not exhibit the same build quality .
35                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  While I applaud the new design  , Toyota seems to be slipping in quality .
36   Examples include fit and finish  had to have the drivers door realigned due to metal, to, metal contact causing terrible rattling  , poor fit of interior parts, which causes a lot of rattling, especially when it's cold out  the auto tranny has a history of serious problems and acts weird, and lastly the paint quality, which chips very easily .

122                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           In our opinion, a bit of faux Italian décor, some nice throw pillows on the bed and smaller than average rooms doesnt really stretch to European, style Boutique Hotel .

132  Upon arriving late through no fault of our own and finding our room double booked we were put up in a nearby sister hotel   until our room was ready the next day and they give us a complimentary bottle of champagne ,  after this though there were no more snags and everything went great ,  hotel staff friendly and helpful ,  rooms were quiet, clean and comfortable ,  food in the restaurant fabulous ,  the situation of the hotel was very convenient ,  just a few mins walk from fishermans wharf with a public transport stop, supermarket, small shops, bars and cafes also really close at hand ,  approx 10 mins walking distance for ferries to alcatraz and bay cruise, etc ,  would definitely stop here again

34                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The rooms were large and clean .
35                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The rooms are very clean, comfortable and spacious and up, to, date .
36                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Rooms in similar hotels would usually be about $250, 300 .
37                                                                                                                     It does suffer, however, from a trend that I have been noticing that as rooms at business class hotels are upgraded ,  particularly with a patch panel for the big LCD, TV ,  drawer space becomes less and less .
38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Why is the cleaning staff telling us they are out of coffee for the rooms ?
39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The rooms were nice, clean and updated .

45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The room was two rooms from the elevators and I could still hear them but it wasn't too bad .
46                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The hotel and rooms were very clean .
47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Great Location Nice Rooms Loved the Swissotel !

51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The rooms were clean and modern .
52                                                                                                                                                                            I ended up with a double on the 7th floor ,  I would've preferred a King since I was alone, but it was one of the renovated rooms so I decided to keep it .
53                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The rooms are large and well, appointed  , the staff was very professional and friendly, and the view was striking !
54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Great location but rooms need some work .
55                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 All on the way from Milwaukee I was telling her how everyone was so nice and the rooms are beautiful .
56                                                                                                                                                                                                 He then told me that they have no more rooms available and i was just going to have to deal with it since i was only staying a night .
57                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I called from my cell phone and asked if they had any rooms available and they said yes its blah blah blah .
58                                                                                                                                                                          When I got to the room, I thought the new rooms would have a plasma since the website implies the new rooms would have them, but I guess those come later   .
59                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I did notice that the bottles of water that they have in the rooms sell for $6 which I think is rediculous .
60                                                                                                                                            There were no king rooms available when we checked in and the woman at the front desk was not overly helpful until we produced a copy of our confirmation wtih the king bed request on it .
61                                                                                                                                              very nice pool and spa on the 42nd floor, rooms and lobby were clean, easy walk to Michigan Ave through via the lower level walkway to the Illinois State center, beds were comfortable .
62                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The actual hotel and rooms were very nice with amazing views, the staff was extremely rude .
63                                                                                                                                                                                                          The rooms are spacious and have nice views, I was NOT impressed with the mattress and every, little, tiny thing costs money .
64                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Very well equiped, the rooms are spacious and very comfortable with every thing you need .
65                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            from other rooms but not nearly bad enough for us not to stay there again .
66                                                                                                                                                                                                                We even got upgraded to one of the corner rooms   which also looked west toward Michigan Ave and the Wrigley building .
67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     as the building rises the noise will get worse as they get closer to guest rooms .
68                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Ive stayed with my family at the hotel previously in two connecting rooms which were nice but unremarkable .
69                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         This time, no connecting rooms were available so we booked a one, bedroom, 1 .
70                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    In our case, it was cheaper than two connecting rooms and a far better experience .
71                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Rooms at the hotel are getting somewhat tired .

75                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The rooms were sleek and cool ,  great views .
76                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I recieved a great deal on the rooms here and it was wonderful .
77                                                                                                                                                                       It was a good hotel, the rooms were clean and there were little things like dressing gowns that were a nice touch but other everyday things let the hotel down .
78                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Our rooms were nice and didn't look worn or old .
79                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The rooms were comparable but I have to admit I loved the Fairmont service, especially the bellhops and front desk .

81                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               While the rooms are a bit dated, the location is great .
82                                                                                                                                                                                                         The bad side is that the rooms are dated and in need of some upgrades, but for $109 a night through Travelocity it was great .
83                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Since we were staying during busy Memorial weekend all the good rooms filled up quickly .
84                                                                                                                            Our family of 4 frequents Chicago and oftentime forgoes the comfort of a more spacious suite just to experience the thrill of the view of the river and Navy Pier that Swissotel's Lakeview rooms provide .
85                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     You can see downtown and or the Navy Pier from most of the rooms .
86                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Great Location great rooms and bed but no help from desk personnel .
87                                                                                                                                                                                                     There is simply no better way to experience the 4th of July in Chicago, than in one of the corner rooms with a view of Navy Pier .

90                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The interior of the guest rooms is decidedly generic, lacking the style of some of Chicago's newer hotels   .
91                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              But the rooms are large and nicely equipped with all the essentials of a business hotel .
92                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           It seems most of the rooms here have great views and mine was no exception .
93                                                                                                                                                                                                                               It could be an excellent property if the rooms were updated with new mattresses, televisions and desks .
94                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The Fairmont and Hyatt next door have a few rooms with a view but not many .
95                                                                                                                                                                                      Suspecting the rooms were allocated under the control of large travel agencies, I immediately called a friend and had them book me using hotels .
96                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          These rooms are right next to the elevators .
97                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Contemporary in its decor, the rooms are spacious and the bathrooms are very nice .
98                                                                                                                                                                                                                    For 2 nights there were 4 of us and for the last night only 2, so I was looking for 2 rooms or a room with 2 beds .
99                                                                                                                                        I originally booked 2 rooms because their online reservation site would only allow you to book a room for 1, 3 people and there was no guarantee that you would get a room with 2 double beds .
100                                                                                                                                the service staff always left our rooms clean, and even arranged my girlfreinds jewelry for her, untangling her necklaces and earrings from each other, and leaving them evenly placed on the bureau !

102                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Great Hotel with Great Rooms .
103                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The rooms were very spacious and clean, especially for downtown Chicago standards .
104                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Most importantly, the rooms were quiet .
105                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The rooms and common areas were bland and far from a top flight hotel .
106                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The hotel is really pretty, but the rooms need some upgrading to be considered anywhere near a 4 5 star hotel .
107                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I would say the best part about this hotel was that it was very very quiet from inside the rooms .
108                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The decor of the rooms and the communal areas is really dated, looks like it hasn't been touched for years .
109                                                                                                                                                               The Swissotel was a great place to stay, rooms were very clean, and quiet at night for a great nights rest, with extremely comfortable beds, and high quality bedding .
110                                                                                                                 We had a pretty bad view on the 27th floor relative to the other rooms which faced Lake Michigan   There's some construction right now Southwards and we stared at a giant mud pit with big cranes the entire visit .
111                                                                                                                                               So, in all, I would definitely stay hereagain, even though the service stinks, the restaurantis for rich patrons with money to blow and the peopleare snobs, the rooms make up for it .
112                                                                                                                  Some of the other hotels in the same class in Chicago might be a little more decorative or chic but their rooms are not as comfortable and dont seem to have the same dependable amenities that the Swissotel has .
113                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Rooms were good, nothing spectacular about them except the views .
114                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The beds were extremely comfortable, rooms were extremely spacious and the bathrooms were as well .
115                                                                                                                                           We didn't check out the normal rooms but my parents were in a &quot normal&quot  room and loved it, and said it was one of the nicest and most importantly cleanest they'd been in lately .
116                                                                                                                                                       From talking to other guests, I concluded that rooms ending with numbers xx1, xx2, xxx19 and xx20 should be avoided unless you enjoy listening to elevators going up and down !
117                                                                                                                                                                                                                  One thing that struck me as backward is that they charge $10 per 24 hours of internet usage in certain guest rooms .
118                                                                                                                                                                          I pointed out to the manager that my firm held a conference there just months before and had used the conference facilities as well as several hotel rooms .
119                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Honestly, I would rate the service and location a three, the rooms a four, and the view a five !
120                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Then we were told that rooms on the top 5 or 6 floors are all non, smoking .
121                                                                                                                                                                                                         The hotel was very nice, rooms were big, the pool hot tub area was very nice, and the location was great and easy to get to .
122                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             It is true that the rooms have a little 'wear', but not to the point of being a problem .
123                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Rooms are dated, our corner room's bathroom was shabby .
124                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  word to the wise, , avoid the rooms ending with 11 .
125                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Rooms were clean, good sized and great views of Navy Pier .
126                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The rooms were very clean and spacious .
127                                                                                                                                                                                                                         While the rooms are quite nice, I was dismayed by the snotty service I received at the Swissotel in Chicago .
128                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              So, while the rooms are very nice, I will never stay at a Swissotel again, in any city .
129                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Then again, the rooms are much larger and the view more than makes up for it .
130                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The room was huge as hotel rooms go .

0    If you've ever had a  Brand X  GPS take you on some strange route that adds 20 minutes to your trip, has you turn the wrong way down a one way road, tell you to turn AFTER you've passed the street, frequently loses the satellite signal, or has old maps missing streets, you know how important this stuff is .

3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The revised chipset allows the GPS to make satellite connections quickly .
4                                                                                                                                                The unit takes very quickly locks on to satellite signals, tracks very well and when you miss a turn or do something unexpected, recalculates a new route very quickly .
5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Hotfix   to lock on to satellite signals works well .
6                                                                                                                                                         On I, 76 in PA, I travelled through a mile long tunnel and it tracked me perfectly even though it obviously could not get satellite signals inside the tunnel .
7                                                           Acquiring satellites is very fast though if you are moving while the acquisition is taking place it will take a little longer to acquire a satellite and of course on a overcast day you may experience difficulty acquiring a signal though understandable .
8                                                                                                                                                                                 I would say that 90% of the time it acquires a satellite within the first 2 minutes or less, the other 10% is due to the above events .
9                                                                                                                                                                 And it is very fast locating satellites, the new interface needs some time to get used to, it is very cool now you can drag the map with your fingers !
10                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It is quick in picking up satellite signals and very responsive with the user interface   .
11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Satellite lock, up and navigation precision was better for TomTom, e .
12                                                                                                                                                         I guess it was because during the traffic jams we encountered I guess it loss contact with the satellites due to interferrence by the tall buildings arroung .
13                   Can pay like $200 or something and get the service for life, HotFix which allows it to get satellites much faster when booting up this is a great feature and my only complaint about past Garmins that I used which was that it took too long to acquire satellites, this eliminates that problem .
14                                                                                      by the time the main menu comes up after turning the device on it generally already has a full 100% signal from the satellites and it's ready to navigate, a beautiful crystal clear LCD widescreen, and tons of other features .
15                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Satellite acquisition time is very fast, as is re, routing .
16                                                                                                                                                     It also has a  hot fix  which finds satellites faster ,  which is very useful for starting your trip immediately and great for recalculating routes very quickly .
17                                                                                                                                                               SATELLITE RECEPTION, , Being in downtown Charlotte with skyscrapers surrounding me, the Nuvi maintained reception everywhere except a parking garage   .
18                                                                                                                                                                                          On a major highway leading into downtown it lost all satellite coverage and told me to make a U, turn on the 6 lane highway !
19                                                                                                                                                                                                         If the  hot fix  satellite performance is supposed to be fast, I'd hate to see the older versions without it .
20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I'd be at my destination before they located the satellites .
21                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     It has no problems locating the satellites and does not get lost .
22                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Improved super fast satellite acquisition
23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I tested it again on a road trip and constantly lost satellite reception .
24                                                                                                                                                                                                                            When I first turned the unit on, it had to search for satellites and pinpoint my location .
25                                                                                                                                                                                                            After turning the unit off and back on again, the GPS unit must search for satellites and  re, locate  me .
26                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Time to search for satellites :
27                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The time that it takes to acqure the Satellites is about 10, 30 seconds .
28                                                                                                                                                                               It lost satellite contact a couple of times on the trip   but apparently picked them up again because there were no skipped directions .
29                                                                                                                                                                                               The device beeps when satellite connection is lost but I never noticed any indication of when the connection came back .
30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        When you turn on the unit, initial satellite connection takes about 3 minutes .
31                                                                                                                                                                                                I really love the new interface, the turn signs at the corner, speed limit indicator and the fast satellite reception .
32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The refreshing rate is fast and locks on to the satellites almost instantly .
33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    It doesn't take long to locate satellites, maybe 15 seconds or so .
34                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Good routing  , easy to use, quick to lock on to satellites .

41                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I took the unit outside to do that, and it found the satellites very quickly .

46                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Many places in Northern Montana and especially Utah lost contact with satellite info .
47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The satellite fix is very fast, about twice as fast as my old one .
48                                                                                                                                                                                              large screen, text to speech street names, quick satellite fixes, and more, I think I made the best choice for my money .

52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The 255W finds satellites faster than any other GPS on the market .
53                                                                                                                                             It includes the new Hot Fit technology and remembers the satellites positions when you turn the GPS off, so the next time you turn it on, it can relocate them very fast .
54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  It also finds the satellite quickly .

61                                                                                                                                                                                                               It grabs satellites quickly and recalculates routes in seconds after I veer off in the wrong direction ."

4          The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .

9                                                                                                                                             It tells you on the main screen your estimated time of arrival which will change depending upon your stops and speed .
10                                                                                                                                                                                         Additionally, I find the data in the odometer screen to be fasscinating .
11                                            Another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .
12                                                                                                                                                                         ,  255w has an arrow at the top of the screen that shows the direction of the next turn .
13                                                                                                                                                                        To make things worse, in the the  Main st  may not be on the screen on the default scale .
14                                                                                                                                                                                 The way map is displayed is good and the wide screen helps to see more map area .
15                                                    Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .
16                                                                                      The most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .
17                                                                                    On the other hand, after about a week of using the Garmin, it seems to understand where we are, and now POIs as far as 25 miles away will show up when the screen is touched .
18                                                                                                                                                                             The screen is easy to see, the voice tells you where you are and it's very accurate .
19                                                                                                                                                                                         I switched to the Nuvi 255W after the screen on my Nuvi 760 got cracked .
20                                                                                                                                                                                                                               > Same screen size as the other 4 .

23                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The home screen shows four options :
24                                                                                                                                 Any time you are viewing the map, you can zoom in or out by tapping the appropriate icon located on the top right of the screen .
25                                                                           I have noticed that when I see a speed limit sign on the road, indicating a change of speed limit for that road, the Nuvi is not far behind in changing the speed limit on the screen .
26                                                                                                                                                               If you missed the spoken directions, you can look at the top of the screen for written directions .
27                                                                                                                                               So, although the Nuvi doesn't verbalize those directions, I can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .
28                                                                                                                                                                                                            The screen is bright and the maps are generally good .
29                                                                                                                                                                                                                                3 Love the touch screen technology
30                                                                                                                                                   There were a few times I drove under overpasses on the interstate and no intersection was shown on the screen .
31                                                                                                                                                                                             Typical of Garmin, the product works well, wide screen is very nice .
32                                                                                                                                   Functionally the only slight problem is that on my unit I have to press pretty hard on the screen if I want to 'drag' the map .
33                                                                                                                         The extra features of the 255W over lesser models that I find highly beneficial include spoken street names and the wide screen display .
34                                                                                                                                                                                                   Now the only screen I get says the system software is missing .
35                                                                                              I use the suction cup mount because I like to keep the screen in my frame of vision without turning my head, but I make sure to take it with me when I park my car .
36                                                                                                                                                             From the map screen it's but 2 presses on the large and accessible touchscreen to get a  Where Am I ?
37    I also realize that even if I crashed differently I had been injured in other ways but the car were still drivable that it's but 1 press on the screen to get direction to the nearest emergency services   from that lovely screen that told me where I was .
38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I just wish the screen is larger .
39                                                                                                                                                                                                         1 Wanted a wide screen model, its difficult to see the 4 
40                                                                                                   4 It has built in picture viewer and a card slot, so insert your memory card, browse to picture browser and you don't need a PC, has enough big screen to enjoy
41                                                                                                                                                                      Its for wide screen models and it fits perfectly my 255w with a flap that covers it screen .
42                                                                                                                                                     I chose a hard type of case that zippered the screen in, as I didn't want the possibility of it sliding out .
43                                                                                                                                             Also, it's hard to view the screen when it's super sunny outside, but the text to speech capability is an advantage .
44                                                                                                                         Before I get into the specifics of my review, let me offer one important piece of advice , ,  BUY A CARRYING CASE to protect the screen !
45                                                                                                 These gadgets have sensitive touchscreen menus, and I think the fact that I didn't protect the screen on my last GPS is the reason it died after only 14 months .
46                                                                                                                                                                                             I had a Nuvi 205 and I really liked it but I wanted a bigger screen .
47                                                                                                                                                                 It's an emergency location feature ,  you can tap the screen to get your latitude and longitude .

49                                                                                                                             Not only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .
50                                                                                                                                        The local  speed limit  is shown on left side of the screen with current driving speed shown at the bottom of the screen .
51                                                                                                                                                                    One thing that would be useful is putting a mute button on the screen available at all times .
52                                                                                                                                                                 Having the speed limit show up on the screen was also great since I was in unfamiliar territory .
53                                                                                                                                     I watched the screen several times as I passed by a speed limit sign, and it would change almost immediately as I passed by !
54                                  I was afraid the screen on one of these things would be too small for me to see, and the last thing I need would be futzing around with a GPS screen when I'm on the road if I wanted to do that, I could drive and read a map !
55                                                                                                                                                                                                              The screen is huge next to some of the units I saw .
56                                                                                                                                                  I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .
57                                                                                                                                                                               It has a very clear and bright screen and is loaded with multiple useful features .
58                                                                                                                                                              It has a great screen presentation that is very easy to read when it is mounted on your windshield .
59                                                                                                                                                                                                         3 inch screen was a slight improvement over my former 3 .
60                                                                                                                                                                                                The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .
61                                                                                                                                                                                              The screen is large so that it is easily read while you're driving .
62                                                                                                                                                                                                              The wide screen and spoken street names are a must .
63                                                             If I'm listening to loud music, I won't be able to hear the exact words but I can hear it vaguely and that is a cue that I should glance down at the top of the screen and see what my next move is .
64                                                                                                                                                     There should be an external volume control on the unit, or at least volume control from the main map screen .
65                                                                                                                                                                                                         The posted speed limit on the screen is pretty cool too .
66                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Also, push every icon on every screen you see .
67                                                                                                                             In both instances this could have been avoided if I had just paid attention to the screen which showed the correct road highlighted .
68                                                                                                                                                    The dashboard mount keeps the unit easily within reach so that you can safely touch the screen while driving .
69                                                                                            Was thinking about buying the 265WT for only $45 more, but decided I didn't need bluetooth or the Traffic Feature which gives you flash advertisements on the screen .
70                                                                                                                         Those are the only 2 differences between the 2 models and I'd rather not have flash advertisements coming up on my GPS screen at random .
71                                                                                                                                                                                            3 Inch screen is awesome to look at both during the day and at night .
72                                       The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .
73                                          The screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .
74                                                                                                                                                                                                 The screen is big enough to view maps, street names, etc easily .
75                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Sufficiently sensitive touch screen
76                                                                                                                                                          Now if Garmin would put a compass on the main screen always pointing to the north, it would be perfect .
77                                                                                                                                                                                                             We love the spoken street names and the wide screen .
78                                                                                                                                                           The 255w does not have a convenient volume control  you must go through the menu system on the screen .
79                                                                                                                                                                                       The screen size makes it really easy to see without being a safety hazard .
80                                                                                                                                                                                                    The background of the screen turns black when it's nighttime .
81                                                                                                                                                                       The user must get into a few layers of the menu to access the touch screen volume control .
82                                                                                                                                                                                                              Screen is clear and maps are pretty easy to follow .
83                                                                                                                                           I look at the direction line at the top bar of the screen to make sure I understand what the verbal instructions were .
84                                                                                                                                                3 inches large screen is large enough for you to see the details of the map yet not distracting you from driving .
85                                                                                                                                                                                                                          3 inches screen and steady performance .
86                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ,  Its a touch screen and a 4 .
87                                                                                                                                                                             3 wide screen also   speak out the streets name and tells you when or how far to turn
88                                                                                                                              ,  Also very quick and I mean quick reroute when you miss a turn plus smooth update position when moving, not choppy on the screen .
89                                                                                                                                                                                            ,  EASY to read day or night you can also adjust the screen brightness
90                                                            One down side is the lack of volume button on the unit you have to adjust the volume form the tool menu on the screen which can be a challenge if you want to change the volume when you are driving .
91                                                                                                                                                After lots of internet research, we settled on the Garmin 255W for the text, to, speech and wide screen features .

21                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Sometimes the blue screen of death appears for no discernible reason .
22                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I began by considering netbooks with screens smaller than the now, standard 10 .

24                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      But with screen brightness cranked up, bluetooth & wi, fi in constant use, some video playback  , and internet radio running, I'm getting a good 8
25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          With wi, fi off & the screen dimmed, I don't think I'll have a problem getting the stated 10 .

29                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I've had the 1005HA, PU1X for a week now ,  on and running applications continuously ,  without a single crash, blue screen, or hangup .

31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               My only complaint with it is that the screen doesn't go back far enough .
32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The touchpad works well, the screen glossy, ness really doesn't bother me, and it's not too bad of a fingerprint magnet .
33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        On full screen display is smooth and no issues .
34                                                                                                                                                                                                       Some iTunes content is a little laggy if it is maximized display, but not full screen for some reason, but switching to full screen display has taken care of that issue for me .
35                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And with a two, fingered gesture on the scratchpad, you can enlarge or shrink the screen .
36              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .
37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   On a full charge, with wireless on, screen brightness on medium, I get a reported 8 .
38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            5 hours with no wireless, and screen brightness on minimum .

41                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  All features worked excellently for me so far especially appreciate the touchpad lock button  as well as the screen off function key .

44                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               you can either move the screen to eliminate the glare, or move the lamp .
45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I'd far rather have this beautifully crisp screen and make the occasional adjustment for glare, than deal with a matte screen 24 7 .
46                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  One of the other complaints I'd come across is how for some, the screen doesn't tilt back far enough .
47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              yeah, you'd probably want the screen to tilt far enough back to lay flat .
48                                                            And if you can't wait to twist yourself into some contortion in bed where you need the screen to go back further than reasonable, you can always invest in one of those $20 lap desks ,  you know, the kind with the beanbag bottom, so that you can shift the desk into whatever ridiculous position will suit your fancy .
49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  and I could have gotten a matte screen, but neither of those  features  impressed me .
50                                                                                                                                                                                                Except for difficulties seeing the entire New York Times crossword puzzle all at once on the screen, the Asus satisfies my needs and seems about as fast as my 5, year, old IBM laptop .
51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I was also nervous about the fact that occasionally the image on the computer screen  shivered , although it normally recovered from that .
52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Also considered lower, end 14, 15  screens for use of the DVD .
53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I like the gloss screen fine .
54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The screen is too small for any meaningful work, but the apps DO work .
55                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Again, the screen is too small for this to be anything more than just satisfying from a purchase standpoint .
56                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             like others have said, it is definitely a fingerprint magnet, and the glossy screen can be a bit of a problem in some lighting conditions .
57                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I received my Asus 1005HA yesterday installed the two gb ram and tried to turn it on and the screen remained blank .
58                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The screen is small, only 1024 x 600 .
59                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I can hear the windows but my screen is totally blank .
60                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I can tell the backlight is on, but all I get is a black screen .
61                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I don't even see the bios screen on startup .
62                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The screen is sharp and bright .
63                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The screen is clear and easily viewed in indoor environments .
64                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           With the view maximized, the screen is large enough to work on documents and read online research materials .
65                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The fashionable glossiness of both body and screen acquires fingerprints and smears rapidly .
66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The shiny screen is reflective, which can be a problem if you have your back to a sunny window or work outdoors .

74                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I'm happy with the screen and resolution choices available .
75                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I usually run IE8 in full screen mode   with a 95% zoom setting and a 1024x600 resolution .

79                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The screen really is too small ,  1024x600 is barely livable .

81                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Screen brightness is very satisfactory .

87                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The cover and screen are glossy and it has a 92% keyboard which is plenty comfortable .
88                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The battery life is excellent, with normal usage I can get about 7 hours easily, more if I turn off WIFI and turn down the screen brightness .
89   One of the downside I have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .

117                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         GLOSSY SCREENS ARE THE STUPIDEST INVENTION OF THIS MILLENIUM .
118                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Seeing reflections on the screen is just plain annoying .
119                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          As new netbooks come out, look for the ones with matt screen and see if it has a good feature set and price .
120                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The screen is very sharp and readable even with the tiny text at this size .
121                                                                                                                                                                                                                             With 1GB of RAM, it really isn't TOO bad to try to run Photoshop or something either  , but the screen would be too small for something like that anyhow .
122                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The battery life is unbelievable, even while using USB to transfer files, watching movies and surfing the internet with screen brightness all the way up .
123                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Factory settings to preserve battery life have the screen luminescence set to 50% but can easily be adjusted to the necessary ambience illumination you may need .
124                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The 1024x600 screen can be set, if you wish, so that it is a 1024x600 viewport to a larger 1024x768 desktop, reachable by moving the mouse to the screen edge .
125                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             This is useful if you have an application that demands a 1024x768 screen .
126                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Screen appearance is enhanced by Asus software, and I do like the appearance and visibility in various lighting situations .
127                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The 10 inch screen started getting to me on the Asus 1005 .
128                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I love the capability of making the screen bigger or smaller with the mouse pad .
129                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The mouse pad is very sensitive so I sometimes find myself on a different part of the screen if I accidentally touch something .
130                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The screen is comfortable and sufficently bright for occassional use .
131                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The screen is crisp and clear, and the unit runs great .
132                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The greatest shortcoming is the small screen resolution .
133                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Yes, screen is small, video card is weak, and keyboard is cramped, but this is the case for other netbooks at this price point .
134                                                                                                                                                                                      I have not done an actual test of the full battery life but from what iv seen in general use it has around 9 hours while running wifi and other applications with around half screen brightness .
135                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Streaming videos from Hulu and Netflix look incredible on this 10 inch screen .
136                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The only minor issue that I have with 1005HA is that it does not allow the screen to rotate further .
137                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The screen rotation angle is good enough for putting the netbook on desktop .
138                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Due to the size of netbooks and a wide screen format, the screen should have been designed to be able to rotate all the way back to inline with the keyboard .
139                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The screen is very bright and sharp with a maximum resolution of 1024x600 .

142                                                                                                                                             It boots up quickly, especially after getting rid of the extra asus software that auto, boots at startup, its battery life is phenomenal, the screen is clear and easy to read, the keyboard is comfortable to type on and feels natural .
143                                                                                                                                               But even with that, and the glossy screen, fingerprint magnet, limited screen tilt, tinny speakers, and intermittent odd glitches, I still think it's a great value and would buy it again today if I were on the market for a netbook .

147                                                                                                                                                                                                                Instead I convert DVDs to DVIX AVI files using Fair Use Wizard and load them on to memory slot card and they play great, 700mb files look fine on this size of screen .
148                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The screen resolution can be a little small at times, but that is a sacrifice I was willing to make .
149                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Yes it does take some getting use to a smaller screen, the key board actually works better than my laptop though  .

151                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Most of my professors teach from Power Points, and it makes my life so much simpler having the PPT on my screen that I can annotate while listening to the lecture .
152                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I have not accidentally knocked it over, but I think it could easily be done  the screen is glossy   .
153                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Purchased this machine to enjoy the convenience of Windows and the larger screen .
154                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             years old, so the screen size was also a concern, but it is adequate for the type of things I use it for .
155                                                                                                                                                   As soon as you connect the VGA cable to an unknown projector and press the function key for projection, it automatically adjusts the size and resolution to fit the projector even if it cannot display properly on its own screen .
156                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The keyboard is great and the screen looks good .
157                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         It's also a shame that this model comes with a glossy screen .
158                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I personally haven't had a problem with the screen, but it would be fairly unusable outdoors in the sun .
159                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      For this extra amount, I was looking for the larger screen, the longer battery life and the keyboard ergonomics .
160                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I have more productivity  flow  on a conventional laptop with a full sized screen and keyboard .
161                                                                                                                             This machine is plenty fast, it's just that if I try to do work with it ,  my office's order entry system as displayed on the netbook screen must be scrolled up and down since it's a  chopped  1024 x 600 height screen, instead of the more usual 786 .
162                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  you lose those 186 pixels and even one line of a large order maintenance screen can require you to have to break the flow of productivity to scroll .
163                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The small screen is probably the biggest drawback .
164                                                                                                                                                                                                             Could be better and don't use the highest resolution unless you want all of your stuff to have the wrong aspect ration on the screen It flattens it to make more visible .
165                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Browsing is amazingly better by using full screen mode on browser with F11 .

169                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            One hint ,  there's a setting that lets you  compress  the screen which makes everything smaller and allows you to fit more on the screen .

20                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I test drove an EX, L and felt the seats were too firm plus, the EX, L seemed too slow .
21                                                                                                                                                                                                                  This Accord has more road noise than I like and the seats tend to be hard, unlike my other Accords .
22                                                                                                                  Engine performance lacks punch after 60, head rest are poor design, lacks driver seat memory rear seat a c, radio system is marginal compared to Bose, Seats are hard and small for a large person .
23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The seats are comfortable, and there is ample leg room in the front and rear .
24                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Most uncomfortable seats in any vehicle I have ever owned .
25                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Only 2 things could make it better  memory seats and a smoother shifting transmission .
26                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Seats are firm but not uncomfortable ,  very BMW like .
27                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Advise anyone considering the L to drive one for awhile if you can ,  some cannot stand the seats .
28                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The seat cover was coming out in between the seats .
29                                                                                                                              The only for sure complaint I have is the seats seems to hurt my back after I drove for a period of time, this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .
30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .
31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Seats are very comfortable and ride is very smooth !
32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        It's a black beauty with comfy leather seats .
33   The front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .
34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .
35                                                                                                                                                  At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .
36                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Great leg room in the back and the seats a very supportive .
37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Door closure is solid, leather seats are very comfortable .
38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Ride is very good, but seats are just a little firm .
39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Seats are not very comfortable and not happy with the heated seats .

31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Service was all good, albeit a bit stoic .
32                                                                                                                                            Unfortunately we didn't get to dine in the hotel restaurant, but I'd say it would be good, if the after hours service is anything to go by !
33                                                                                                                                                      I'd highly recommend the Tuscan Inn based on location, cheerfulness of staff, aesthetics in the room and general overall service .

36                                                                                                                                                                         There was also a gentleman offering massage at this time and we met a few people who had enjoyed his services .
37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The food and service were both excellent .
38                                                                                                                                                             This was probably not the best pick for us as we don't like tourist areas and Fishermans Wharf if one big tourist service .
39                                                                                                                                                                               There are many public transportation options including the cable cars, the trolley line and bus service .
40                                                                                                                                                  The highlight of this hotel for us was the service offered by the staff, particularly the two concierges on duty while we were there .
41                                                                                                                                                                                                       Their service was of the level and knowledge I would expect at at 5, star hotel .
42                                                     One day we had the do not disturb sign on the door before the maid had come so we could rest, and when we finally stepped out for about an hour, we changed the sign for maid service and everything was perfect when we returned !
43                                                                                                            Amenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   .
44                                                                                                               At this point I asked to be put through to Best Western Customer Services and amazingly our room was changed to a king bed suite as per our reservation within the hour .
45                                                                                                                                                                                                       They state that there is an obligatory service charge for tables of more than 6 .
46                                                                                                                             We dined as a party of 4 and were still hit with this and then the waitress failed to hand over $10 of change taking this as an additional service charge .
47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   We were very impressed with the service we received .
48                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The concierge service is second to none .
49                                                                                                                                          Tuscan Inn has it all, exellant location,very close to public transport, very clean, impeccable, friendly service and a supermarket opposite .
50                                                                                                                                               We found a great breakfast place just around the corner in Taylor St, called Darren's Cafe, good prices with excellant food and service .
51                                                                                                                                                                                    Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .
52                                                                                                                                                                                                              very clean,well maintained,with efficient,if not overly friendly service .
53                                                                                                                                                                                          The hotel makes a big thing of the coffee bisc service in the morning,and this is quite nice .
54                                                                                                                                                                             I'd say that,as far as the evening   wine service is concerned,if you happen to be in the hotel,it's fine .
55                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Did not eat at the restaurant, but room service was great .
56                                                                                                                                                                                      Overall, the stay at The Tuscan Inn was great and would highly recommend due to the room service .
57                                                                                                                                                                                                                      There are other hotels in the area who do not offer room service .
58                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The service in the hotel was really good .
59                                                                                                                                                     The restaurant in the hotel ,  Cafe Pescatore ,  does the breakfast run for room service, it was adequate but a little overpriced .
60                                                                                                         Lunch and dinner room service is provided by North Beach Pizza, which deliveries many Italian specialties including pasta, entrees, salads, sandwiches and of course ,  pizza .
61                                                                                                                           However, there are countless restaurants of all sorts and price ranges within a 1, 4 block walk of this hotel, there is little reason to order room service .
62                                                                                                                                                                                                   We did not use this service but thought it was nice that it was available if needed .
63                                                                                                                      We did not eat at the hotel restaurant, we chose to eat at the IHOP around the corner for breakfast and it was good food and service, and they are open 24 hours .
64                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Maid service was prompt and outstanding .
65                                                                                                                                                                    very good hotel ,  great location, concierge extremely helpful, decor is nice and the maid service was excellent   .

67                                                                                                                                                                          The adjacent Cafe Pescatero was handy for breakfast but had some hiccups in service, but it was okay overall .
68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , provide service like high end hotels .

74   The hotel is conveniently located to the shopping centre across the road, and we made use of this to purchase our breakfast requirements, as we had not had great service from the adjoining cafe Pescatore for our evening meal and thought we would do our own thing each morning .
75                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Housekeeping service was very inadequate, though .
76                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       and the service was just ok too .
77                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The whole trip was ruined by the guest service of the hotel .
78                                                                                                                                                                                      They say they pride themselves on being the best in guest service but I was not impressed at all .
79                                                                                                                                                                                                    The valet parking was overpriced, the service was terrible, and the coffe was cold .
80                                                                                                                                                         service was extra good, very friendly and there is a great cafe across the street   which has the best breakfast in the world .
81                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The service was fine with the exception of check, in .
82                                                                                                                                                                         From reading other reviews, it seems as though this hotel has significant lapses in service from time to time .
83                                                                                                                                                                        Nevertheless, I did like this hotel,  the rooms, location, and most of the service and I would stay here again .
84                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Nice place but service could be better
85                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Overall we had a nice stay but just had some minor service issues .
86                                                                                                                                                                                            When we finally found the church later, the service times she had given us were wrong, too .
87                                                                                                                           Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .
88                                                                                                                           The hotel is pretty much as you'd expect from the chain , nice clean rooms well serviced, and the staff were extremely helpful,  very pleasant to deal with .
89                                                                                                                                                                         Service was poor and they got our order wrong, but they did correct it at no extra cost and the food was good .
90                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Great service and friendly Front Desk .
91                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The Concierge service is excellent .
92                                                                                                                                     Valet parking was $36 a day, but we're not complaining because other SF wharf hotels have charged us a similar fee even without the valet service .
93                                                                                                                                                 This hotel is truly a value for the mid, level traveler looking for excellent accomodations and the HIGHEST LEVEL OF SERVICE ANYWHERE !
94                                                                                                                                                                                                     But the maid service was excellent, it was very clean and the bed was comfortable .
95                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The service from every staff member we encountered was delightful .
96                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Great location service and beer .
97                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The hotel room was average although the service was good .
98                                                                                                                                                      In accordance with the Tuscan Inns Italian style theme a coffee tea biscotti service was open from 6am till 9am in the mornings .
99                                                                                                                                                                                              In the evenings from 5pm till 6pm a wine, beer and sparkling water service was available .
100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Maid service was prompt, too .
101                                                                                                                                                                                                                 the service is poor, and for those used to staying in Kimpton hotels .
102                                                                                                                                                                                                 There is simply not the service, oriented feeling one is used to in this hotel group .
103                                                                                                                              It has everthing you need to have a great time in a great city,  location, good service, great food  , comfortable rooms and a complimentary happy hour .
104                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The cafe is comfortable and service was attentive and polite .
105                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Room service at the hotel is limited :
106                                                                                                                    The rooms are small but very clean, charmingly decorated with a view of the little flowered courtyard, comfy beds, plenty of pillows   towels and smiling service .
107                                                                                                                                                                   I really didn't get a chance to experience the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .
108                                                                                                                                                             One other thing, I took my family to the eating establishment connected to this hotel and the service there was TERRIBLE !
109                                                                                                                                The concierge, in turn, told us to see the bellman, who said the shuttle did not run on weekends and he knew nothing about how to arrange the service .

119                                                                                                                               I had breakfast and dinner a few times at the restaurant joined to the hotel, Cafe Pescatore, and thought the food and the service were both very good .

123                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And the hotel restaurant food and service was   awful .
124                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     great rooms fantastic location and great service !
125                                                         i would also urge other vistors to prebook Alacatraz with Blue and Gold Fleet direct on there website before they arrive in San Fran as you can pick up your tickets at the self service machine without the miles of queues !
126                                                                                                                                                                                    The food at the &quot Cafe&quot  is quite &quot hotel, like&quot  but the service makes up for it .
127                                                                                                                                                                                            friendly service was evident each day and the gentleman conceirge was patient and helpful .
128                                                                                                                                                  The valet guy was extremely helpful and very friendly but the check in guest services staff on the whole uninterested and unhelpful .

137                                                                                                                                    I was also disappointed that the hotel's &quot room service&quot  came from a nearby pizzeria, but the hotel still charged a fee on each delivery .

30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I ordered room service one night, and the food was delightful, and the service was fast and friendly .
31                                                                                                                                                                                     If you need a hotel with services like access to a computer or a concierge who can do more than give directions and order full price tickets to events then don't stay here .
32                                                                                                                                              However the hotel is very large and loses some personal service as a result ,  the service we received was variable, with little recognition of our Platinum Priority Club Rewards status, and slow room service   .
33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    For a little extra money, the soon to be Crowne Plaza over the road offers far better service yet with the same great location

36                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I would definitely stay here again for the location and the great customer service .
37                                                                                                                                                                             Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .
38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The service was the worst service we have EVER recieved in my life the worst .
39                                                                                                                                                                                                              30am, service finished at 11am, there was a queue for the toasters and the cooked breakfast was uninspiring ,  the ingredients seemed poor quality .
40                                                                                                                                                                                      Room service is expensive but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a £6 .
41                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , but after I called room service it was promptly fixed .
42                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            There are no bottle openers or cork screws in the room so ask room service for them if you need them .
43                                                                                                                                                                                                       There is also a laundry service at the hotel, but they also change an outrageous amount so unless you have an expense account I wouldn't plan on using it .
44                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Reception was busy but service was good throughout my stay .
45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                But there are much better hotels to choose from for the same price and at least you get some good service and respect from staff .
46                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The room and bathroom were very clean and serviced each day to a high standard .
47                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The main restaurant is on floor 1 and offers a full cooked and continental buffet was good choice and generally very good service .
48                                                                                                                                                                                                                       If you're looking for a comfortable, clean hotel with a mid, range level of service and easy access, then this hotel would serve you well .
49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       We ate on evening once at the Garfunkels pub in the mall, it was typical chain restaurant food but fast with good service .
50                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Did not use any other facilities or order room service .
51                                                                                                                                                                                                                             There was an adequate self service buffet, not a huge selection or very well presented, cloths were not changed when food got spilt .
52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Exceptionally poor ,  and surprising ,  service .
53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Great location service questionable .

59                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                We were very pleased with the room, and the staff was all very nice and helpful, including the concierge service .

61                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   but be prepared for some poor service quality .
62                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Service can be slow at peak times with waits up to one hour at times, but on average I had to wait no longer that around 30 minutes .
63                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The food was excellent, the service was very friendly and the prices cheap .
64                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The food is excellent and the service great .
65                                                                                                                                                                                                    Service was friendly, our room was on the highest floor  , but that wasn't a problem because of the lifts, and we had a great view of the city from the room .
66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 but after having spent an entire week in London, I came to realize that just about anybody in the service industry is just that .
67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Service was impeccably English hotel, wide .
68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The breakfast is self service on the first floor, not cheap   but not bad either as there is plenty of choice .
69                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The card which is left for you to leave comments and review your service went missing from my room on the fourth day which speaks volumes .
70                                                                                                                                                                                               The service is pleasant enough, and I was given a room with a nice view of central London   on the 14th floor without having to ask, despite booking on Priceline .
71                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           This is suppose to be a full service hotle, but I would only classify it at best as a Motel 6 quality .
72                                                                                                                                                                                                  Service at reception both for checking in or out can be slow and although I've always found the staff to be pleasant, not all of them fully understand english .
73                                   The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .
74                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      On the first night of my stay, I tried to use room service .
75                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   On the third night I tried room service again .
76                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Room service pesonnel called me up after about 45minutes asking if I really needed the stuff that I had ordered .
77                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           the atmosphere is such that they are always right and that a customer is doing them a service by staying at the hotel .
78                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Is this the level of customer service you want ?
79                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             On my last day I used the concierge service to arrange a cab for me .

111                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Service was great and the concierge was very helpful .
112                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Excellent location shame about the service !
113                                                                                       When we wanted to watch a pay per view movie, was informed by reception there was a problem ,  it later transpired that we had been given an Aircrew room, where there is no mini, bar, pay per view movies turned off at reception, no menu's or room service available .
114                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Also we were later informed that only executive rooms had the service of mini bar !
115                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The maid service was excellent and we felt very happy with our choice .
116                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     We took a private car service from airport to hotel, and it cost 55 pounds .
117  Don't use the restaurant or room service, there's plenty of places to eat outside the hotel, there's a mini Tesco for groceries, a larger grocery store   plenty of internet cafe's, a Paul's Boulangerie right by the tube, great fro a quick breakfast, the Gloucester Road tube stop is a 3 minute walk, plenty of busses to High Street fabulous shopping !
118                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   My daugher and I average about $70 a dinner regardless of whehter we ate out or did room service ,  ,  YIKES .

122                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    For the price, cleanliness, service and quality it definately deserves a higher star rating .
123                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I wish that the hotel had better service, however .
124                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   To get ice, you have to first get a bucket from room service .
125                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    To get Room Service, it called Housekeeping .
126                                                                                                                                                                                                                                For a similarly good location  , you can stay at the London Hilton Metropole for the same price and receive much better service .
127                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Quite snooty or surly service at reception, from two separate people .
128                                                                                    Staff were mostly ethnic origin, presenting a couple of communication problems at check in   room service was slow and fairly bland   and we noticed a lack of acknowledgement by any staff as we walked around the premises, again unusual for such a high profile company .
129                                                                                                                                                                         I stayed in room 354 ,  on the Exec Floor ,  no bathrobes, no newspaper delivery  , room service crockery standing outside room for almost 24 hours un movedand poor service in Bistro .
130                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         We had room service the night we arrived, and it was good quality, and arrived quickly .
131                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Super dinner and attentive service .
132                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Food was OK, service very haphazard .
133                            It is very close to Gloucester Rd tube station, has plenty of restaurants, pubs, supermarkets, chemists within 100 yds, is close to Hyde park for a run walk in summer, near Kensington High street, rooms are always clean and have recently been refurbed, room service menu is better than other hotel chains, breakfast is good .
134                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       We had one evening meal in the ground floor restaurant, well cooked again, but the service was very slow .
135                                         Finally, the hotel did nothing to inform us about a transit strike on the tube and when we heard about it on our own and asked the concierge for help with getting to the airport, he advised taking a cab service for 50 pounds plus banking holiday surcharge, , we luckily found a cheaper alternative by ourselves .

137                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I noticed on my last stay that the quality of service was very diminished .
138                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            We were on the 20th floor   very happy with the rooms   the service .
139                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I can say that every time I have been disappointed with either the value, standards, cleanliness,service of the hotel .

141                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Excellent location and service .
142                                                                                                                                                                                                    Concierge was very helpful  we didnt take the English breakfast but the downstairs bar offers croissants and Starbucks coffee and the service was very nice .
143                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Service was efficient but far from personal, how could it be when the place was as a large as it was !
144                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 It met all my expectations ,  very clean room w pleasing modern decor, above average housekeeping services, accomodating staff .
145                                                                     Additionally, one other problem was that room service was very very inefficient ,  requesting a menu to be brought to the room took 45 minutes and the guy actually had the audacity to suggest he read it to me over the phone instead of sending one up, after I had to call three times .
146                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Room service will bring a bucket of ice any time, or theres a machine on the 25th floor .

151                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I still can't figure out if it's a difference in  service  from US and UK standards or if it's just this hotel .

22                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Too bad on several days, they were not able to service the room until late afternoon .
23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     We ordered room service for breakfast and were not disappointed .
24                                                                                                                                       My father and I were in town for four days from Los Angeles to catch a game at Wrigley Stadium, and the front desk and bar staff were all very friendly and accommodating, providing recommendations to us about the attractions, and transportation services .
25                                                                                                                                                                    Overall, I think the Swissotel is a perfectly nice facility and I feel like we got a good deal but I would never consider paying full price to stay there as you can get the same amenities and service at lower rates elsewhere .

27                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The concierge and service line were both just okay .
28                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         No greeting when you called them   and the service was fine but indifferent .

51                                 30 and they said we needed a voucher and mentioned nothing of room service, we did get the voucher and enjoyed a very good breakfast buffet in their 2nd restaurant, not the Palm like we were toldWhen we were checking out we asked why we got charged for the pool when it states the package comes with it and it says in their books in the room that its free .

95                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   When you do find the ice, it is in a service area often cluttered with maid carts .
96                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Service is excellent, the personnel strive to make you feel better .
97                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                One very simple, but very appreciated touch was the water service in the front lobby .
98                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Overall, this hotel from top to bottom ,  service, furnishings, beds, appeal ,  is akin to a mediocre Holiday Inn .
99                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The furniture was a little worn but the hotel's service and location made up for it .

139                                                                                                                                                 Now on the side of the service andstaff, there is a real &quot snobbish&quot  attitude that isprobably related to the fact that the Swedish, Germanprogeny of Europe work at the hotel, except as luggagehandlers, toilet cleaners and car parkers .
140                                                                                                                                                                                                              So, in all, I would definitely stay hereagain, even though the service stinks, the restaurantis for rich patrons with money to blow and the peopleare snobs, the rooms make up for it .

144                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I had a note slipped under my door early Friday morning telling me that they were working on the guest services movie thing and that they hoped to have it back working that night .
145                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Service was great as I was greeted immediately by bellstaff from my taxi and the desk person greeted me with a great smile .

149                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Swissotel offered all the services extras I like , ,  lots of cabs, in, hotel bar, great views, room service, etc .

151                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Honestly, I would rate the service and location a three, the rooms a four, and the view a five !

155                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Room service was efficient, average priced, and decent food .
156                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I ordered room service late on Saturday night, and the gentlemen who brought it up was one of the most pleasant people I encountered in Chicago !

158                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            We spent last weekend at the Swissotel and were delighted with the service, the views and the amenities .

11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   It's the perfect size and weight to take almost anywhere .
12                                                                                                                                                                             The machine has the most comfortable small keyboard I've ever used, because the keys are flat and so the surfaces that your fingerpads touch are actually about the size of standard keyboards .
13   It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .
14                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Smaller size videos   play even smoother .
15                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 keyboard is actually a pleasure to use inspite of small size
16                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Size is one of the smaller for a 10  yet still maintaining reasonable useability .
17                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Ended up with this one based on smaller size, lighter weight and the overwhelming number of positive reviews .
18                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Pro's ,  I so wanted to love the small size, long battery life, brilliant blue color and light weight .
19                                                                                                                                                                                                           The performance is great for it's size ,  remember these are not designed to be speed demons but to be highly portable and cordless for extended periods of time .

21                                                                                                                                        Small, easy to grab and go, and can do your business in places that wouldn't open a full size laptop, easy to take notes on, or keep copies of what your working on from your main PC and continue working on it where ever you are .
22                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The keyboard isn't quite full sized of course, but very easy to get used to .
23                                                                                                                                  I had some real problems trying to use my Toshiba Satellite when flying for the past few years, and the distance between the top of the display and the edge of the netbook when open is a practical size to get my work done on a flight .
24                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The keyboard, more than 90% standard size, is just large enough .
25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,  don't know why they use the screen size most do ,  1024 x 600 seems cramped
26                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Everything I needed in a laptop without the heavy, bulky size .
27                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The overall size seems right on target, small enough to easily travel, but large enough to be usable .
28                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Full sized laptops are so freaking bulky, heavy, and the battery wouldnt even make it though one of my evening classes .
29                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Surprisingly readable screen for the size .
30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Speaking of which, the keyboard's relatively large size ,  at 92% of the size of a normal one ,  writing longer texts on it is no problem .
31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     My only complaint is the small, compressed size of the UP and DOWN arrows, but I suppose that was probably unavoidable .
32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Someone else suggested going to the store first to check out the size .
33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1 inches is a bit small, so make sure you check some 10 inch models out at Best Buy or Office Max to make sure you're ok with the size .
34                                                                                                                                                                                                                     It runs quietly and operates Windows efficiently, staying incredibly cool compared to the instant burn, your, lap sauna of my full, sized HP Pavillion .
35                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Speaking of typing, the keyboard is great, almost full size .

45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I needed this for a business trip because my full size laptop needs service .
46                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              This netbook is great and I love its small compact size and ultra portability .
47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               My advice is to visit a store to personally try the keyboard and screen size .
48                                                                                                                                                                                         although the screen is relatively small to my eyes   it wasn't really hard to get used to the size and the screen is clear and bright, no prob reading articles and writing essays .
49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          One of the things that I found difficult to get used to is the size of the screen .
50                                                                                                                                                                                                                Also tried a full size Logitech Trackman   and a little wired Logitech notebook mouse sucks like all mice but usable if a mouse is your idea of a good time .
51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I'm using it with a Xion 2 fan pad that folds up to about the size of the closed netbook and runs off a USB port .
52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The screen is very sharp and readable even with the tiny text at this size .
53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        And you can't beat the price with a stick compared to a full size laptop or desktop .
54                                                                                                                                                      The small size makes it very easy to carry compared to a standard laptop, the long battery life is really great, and the speed and performance using various wi, fi connections was better than I expected it to be   .
55                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The keyboard is excellent and even though only 92% the size of a full size keyboard, feels like the big one .
56                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The overall size is just perfect for what I wanted .
57                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The keyboard is just the right size .
58                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The battery life is to die for ,  my full size laptop doesnt have 10
59                                                                                                                                                                                                               Due to the size of netbooks and a wide screen format, the screen should have been designed to be able to rotate all the way back to inline with the keyboard .
60                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I love the lightweight, small size of this product .
61                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The power adapter is a nice small size

65                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I was never a fan of really large laptops or even standard sized ones as I like to stick to the definition of  portable,  so this fit's the bill .
66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Like how they made keyboard as large as possible unlike Qosmio 17  which is almost same size .
67                                                                                                                                                                                                      Instead I convert DVDs to DVIX AVI files using Fair Use Wizard and load them on to memory slot card and they play great, 700mb files look fine on this size of screen .

70                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I love the feel of typing on it, and have not had any issues transferring from a regular, sized keyboard to a smaller one .
71                                                                                                                                             I was also worried that it's small size would equate to something delicate, but I am rough on my electronics, and the ASUS has handled a few rough tousles with textbooks in a bag slung into my car seat without any problems .
72                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   years old, so the screen size was also a concern, but it is adequate for the type of things I use it for .
73                                                                                                                                         As soon as you connect the VGA cable to an unknown projector and press the function key for projection, it automatically adjusts the size and resolution to fit the projector even if it cannot display properly on its own screen .
74                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 But the projection was always perfect in full size and proper aspect ratio .
75                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I have more productivity  flow  on a conventional laptop with a full sized screen and keyboard .
76                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             If I were looking to get work done quickly, I would pay the extra money to go full, sized, even if it's slower .
77                                                                                                                                                                                                                The big one for me is its small size meaning that I can put it in the smaller pocket of the backpack and nobody would know that there was a laptop in there .
78                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0 out of 5 stars PERFECT SIZE NETBOOK, September 23, 2009

12                                                 For example, on the route from Rocky Mountain National park to Arches National Park Garmin's route is 40 mins shorter on a 7 hour drive because it chooses shorter route along minor highways instead of longer route along I, 70 with higher speed limit .

15   That newer interface, as another reviewer has mentioned, gives you speed limits on some major roads, shows you your current speed, puts the zoom buttons closer together, changes text size to give you road names, and shows you the direction of the next upcoming turn near the distance to the turn .
16                                                                                                                                                                                        SPEED, , on most major highways, it tells what the speed limit is for that road   AND tells you what your speed is .
17                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Indicates posted speed limits of the road you are on

22                                                                                                                                                                                         And, it's nice that the Garmin tells you that, at your current speed, you'll reach your destination in 43 minutes .
23                                                                                                                                                                                  When you are looking at the map, you are shown the speed limit for the road you are travelling on, and your actual speed .
24                                                                                                                     I have noticed that when I see a speed limit sign on the road, indicating a change of speed limit for that road, the Nuvi is not far behind in changing the speed limit on the screen .
25                                                                                                                                 I can see that this could at some point become out of date if the governing authority changes the speed limit on a particular road, but it is a cool function nonetheless .
26                                                                                                                                                                                                          It was fun to know where you are and the speed that you are going and the time you will be there .
27                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        6 Love the speed limit and actual speed indicators .

30                                                                                                                                                                                     I really love the new interface, the turn signs at the corner, speed limit indicator and the fast satellite reception .

32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , alerting you that a rest stop is coming up in a mile, or speed alerts .

34                                                                                                                                                                                  The local  speed limit  is shown on left side of the screen with current driving speed shown at the bottom of the screen .
35                                                                                                                                                                                      I also enjoy the estimated time of arrival feature that recalibrates itself automatically based on your travel speed .
36                                                                                                                                                                                                           Having the speed limit show up on the screen was also great since I was in unfamiliar territory .
37                                                                                                                                                                               I watched the screen several times as I passed by a speed limit sign, and it would change almost immediately as I passed by !
38                    I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .
39                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The road I live off of, the speed limit is 45, the GPS says that the speed limit is 50 .
40                                                                                                                                                                                         From what I have seen as far as the speed limit issue is that it is off only by 5mph, but dead on in other places .
41                                                                                                                                                                ,  The speed limit sign on the display is handy but in the first week of using the GPS I found it had the wrong speed limit a couple times .

43                                                                                 I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .
44                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I also really like the way it shows my speed and the posted speed limit .
45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The posted speed limit on the screen is pretty cool too .

53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The speed limit is usually correct except on recently modified highways .
54                                                                                                                            I often find myself wondering if the speed limit changed and I didn't see the sign, so for this one feature I leave the unit on even if it is not navigating to a set location .
55                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     If it helps me avoid one speeding ticket it will have paid for itself .

57                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              It knows exactly what the speed limit is on all major routes .

61                                                                                                                                                                                              LOCAL SPEED LIMIT SOMETIMES WERE NOT CORRECT,THEN WE WOULD PASS A SPEED LIMIT SIGN & IT WOULD CORRECT ITSELF .

65                                                                     What I like most about the 255W is that it shows the road's speed limit right above your actual speed, which I find most helpful, since, again, I use it mostly in areas where I'm not familiar with the roads and local speed limits .
66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The new speed limit display on the 205 255 is quite helpful .

14                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     If you want a stable, fast, visually appealing and advances OS, W7 will not disappoint .
15                                                                                                                                      It does boot up faster than Vista, I do like the taskbar at the bottom as you can  pin  icons to start all of your programs and you can start a program with the desired file opening .
16                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Although Win 7 seems a bit faster than Vista did, I do not notice any decrease in the start, up time .
17                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      It may be that Win7 is faster, sounder, prettier, etc .
18                                                                                                                                                                                                         Yes the comp does boot a bit faster, but it's going to take a lot sequences to break even on the time spent so far .
19                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       It may or may not be a little faster .

22                                                                                                                                                              How about allowing the user to keep the menu open so thathe she doesn't have to repeatedly click to open it if there's a failure or the connection is to slow ?
23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1 Very fast SDHC scanning speed in comparison to vista and xp  big headache relief .

25                                                                                                                                                                               5 Seems to load the desktop much faster than vista, but it might be because I have 2 gigs of ram on my w7 netbook and only 1 on my vista one .
26                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              This is much faster than visata and I love it .

28                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      When I ran Vista, it was a bit slower .
29                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         But Windows 7 is definitely faster !
30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   It is also way faster than what I experience using Windows XP, but I won't get into that .
31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        It is more stable than Vista and wakes up from sleep much faster, also boots faster .
32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              It boots faster and shuts down faster than XP .
33                                                                                                                                                                                                                XP Mode worked on everything I had except an Honestech analog video capture device, but seemed to be slower .
34                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I like many other people, was running Vista and tired of it being so slow and crashing .

36                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The speed at which the upgrade completed is quite fast and the driver hardware detection was seamless .

106                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I say my start up was cut down by half the previous time and it closes even faster .
107                                                                                                                                                                                                         There are less steps to get to files, every application opens faster even desktop gadgets seem to function better .
108                                                                                                                                                                               I'm been using Windows 7 since its inception I upgraded from beta to RC to finally RTM and I can tell you right now it is fast and reliable .
109                                                                                                                                                                                                          Boot up of the Operating System is slower in the RTM for whatever reason but on newer hardware it is pretty fast .
110                                                                                                                                                                                                                Obviously compared to XP you know it will be slower going in but I am very happy with the operating system .
111                                                                                                                                                                                                               It's fast, it doesn't crash, and the interface is clean and far more Mac, like than any previous OS from M$ .
112                                                                                                                            I own XP Professional and wanted a nice, clean install of Win7 so I didn't have a bunch of legacy files hanging around to slow down Win7 so I reformatted the HD before doing the Win7 install .
113                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    It is very fast and very user friendly .
114                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Although most are saying that the start up is faster  I happen to disagree, I feel its about the same .
115                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It takes a little work to setup and doesn't run you application as fast as they would natively .
116                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You need a faster CPU and extra memory if you plan on using this a lot .
117                                                                                                                                               I am very happy with the program, it is much faster, I upgraded from Windows xp, the bad part is there is no driver available to install for my HP wireless printer to work .

175  Upon arriving late through no fault of our own and finding our room double booked we were put up in a nearby sister hotel   until our room was ready the next day and they give us a complimentary bottle of champagne ,  after this though there were no more snags and everything went great ,  hotel staff friendly and helpful ,  rooms were quiet, clean and comfortable ,  food in the restaurant fabulous ,  the situation of the hotel was very convenient ,  just a few mins walk from fishermans wharf with a public transport stop, supermarket, small shops, bars and cafes also really close at hand ,  approx 10 mins walking distance for ferries to alcatraz and bay cruise, etc ,  would definitely stop here again

21                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The hotel was a bit busy during this weekend, but the staff did a great job of helping me with whatever I needed .
22                                                                                                                                                                                                         My only criticism would be that perhaps due to the size of the building and it was busy that staff appeared a bit impersonal .
23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The Hotel staff were professional, but the fornt desk was somewhat slow at check in .
24                                                                        My father and I were in town for four days from Los Angeles to catch a game at Wrigley Stadium, and the front desk and bar staff were all very friendly and accommodating, providing recommendations to us about the attractions, and transportation services .
25                                                                                                                                                             Instead we were offered a rude and incompetant staff, amateur and slow valet, over, priced internet, garage and fitness room access charges and an inept business office .
26                                                                                                                                               Room 1619 was a very nice room, had a great view, beds were soft and very nice to sleep in, TV was very nice, show was very nice, staff was awesome saw to every need I inquired about .

30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The rooms were great, the staff was excellent .
31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Very close to everything, or the front staff will hail a cab for you .
32                                                  You come to a place like Trip Advisor and its so, so hard to tell fact from fiction or even to tell whether or not someone was having a bad day when they arrived or left or whether or not a guest was rude him herself and thus caused the hotel staff to be standoffish or what .

106                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     would be satisfactory for security, and a slight air of detachment by the staff .
107                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Swissotel Chicago is good hotel, very nice, very helpful and nice staff .

109                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The front desk staff can be clueless about this stuff, too, just handing you attitude if you complain .
110                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      At checkin, the staff never made eye contact and only went through the motions .
111                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Bell staff was attentive and available .
112                                                                                                                                            From the moment we checked in, the staff was courteous and meet every need, including arranging for a crib for our daughter and making sure it was safely set up before leaving our room .
113                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    However, the staff was very friendly and helpful .
114                                                                                                                                                                                The young lady that checked us in was very pleasant and I was very appreciative of the articulate directions given to us by one of the staff members .
115                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Check, in and check, out were a breeze  , and the staff was just fine .
116                                                                                                                                                                                    My biggest complaint is I got used to the Fairmont's treatment, the staff is very well trained to meet your every need and are over accomodating .
117                                                                                                                                              I guess the thing that bothers me most is that from the lobby decor and staff attitudes, this hotel is trying to be very snooty but then you go to your room and it is a piece of junk !
118                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       We found the staff to be helpful and friendly .

137                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The other big gripe was with the reception staff, who were rude .

141                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Very classy entrance, nice staff .

143                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Everything was wonderful, including the staff and service .
144                                                                                  Now on the side of the service andstaff, there is a real &quot snobbish&quot  attitude that isprobably related to the fact that the Swedish, Germanprogeny of Europe work at the hotel, except as luggagehandlers, toilet cleaners and car parkers .
145                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The front desk staff was friendly as well .
146                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The location of the hotel is also good and the staff seemed friendly .
147                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The hotel seemed understaffed at the front desk as there was only one agent when I checked in .

151                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I agree with other reviewers who found the staff to be efficient, but not terribly personable .
152                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Hotel is staff is courteous on the most part .
153                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The front desk staff was professional and very helpful .
154                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Swissotel has a famous restaurant inside it and the staff in there are charming and attentive .
155                                                                                                                                                                                                          Service was great as I was greeted immediately by bellstaff from my taxi and the desk person greeted me with a great smile .
156                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Staff seemed efficient though not overly friendly, no good morning, etc .
157                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The worst were the clorox, like smell on that floor and the level of service provided by the staff .
158                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The staff is not helpful and sometimes hardly able to understand even a simple English sentence .
159                                                                                                                                                                    Back in the room, the cleaning staff never made it there before 4pm in the afternoon, not very exciting when you have to spend a rainy weekend in the windy city !
160                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And due to the lack of a sign, you cannot indicate to the cleaning staff early in the day that the room is ready .
161                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Extremely helpful staff, a very quiet, clean and safe property .
162                                                                                                                                                                                          FIrst at check in the desk staff individuals were a bit rude and almost seemed to be looking down at people who are not business travelers .
163                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I did not find the service staff to be above average in any way, with the exception of the lovely concierge .
164                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Front desk staff were not super easy to work with but it wasn't too bad .

175                                                                                                                                                                         We were a little nervous after reading some of the reviews regarding the attitude of the staff, especially since we booked the room through a discount site .
176                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I was concerned that the hotel staff would not be KID friendly, but they were all great !

5     The transmission is horrible, it shifts revs horribly at the wrong times, it putters when it hits 1 1 2 rpms while coasting unless you rev it or hit the breaks, if you try to start the car in really cold weather it makes a horrible grinding noise, the dash rattles ALL the time, when I try to accelerate getting on the freeway it doesnt move & scares me and when it does move it revs even after take your foot from the gas .

32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 At this rate, the Transmission will go out @ 37,000 miles right after my Warranty expires !
33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Obviously they moved the costs around to provide for the new higher power V6 and the 6 speed transmission, which are so far the car's only redeeming features !

37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The transmission cant make up its mind it hesitates to shift .

15       I have held off from getting any GPS unit for a long time because I have a book of maps for the United States and I have always been able to update the travel  atlas  and supplement that with free maps from the internet via Google, Yahoo, etc .

24                                              Very disappointing that the product does not come with a standard power cable or even a USB cable ,  especially considering that is what you must have to use for software updates and product registration .

26                                                                                                                                              5 It came with the latest maps  Garmin City Navigator NT North America 2009  and I didn't have to update it .
27                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The maps seem to be fairly updated .
28                                                                                                                                                   I found too many users who said that the traffic update feature   is not all that dependable a feature .
29                                                                                                                                          I found the maps to be inaccurate at first, but after I updated them from Garmin's website everything is golden .

31                                                                                                                                                                   Also make sure you update the unit software from the Garmin website on a regular basis .
32                                                                                                                                                                                             Use the  Webupdater  so that the unit is running at its peak .
33                                                                                 I avoided the more complex ones as I had read that FM updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .
34                                                                                                                                                          It can be done by phone but if you do it that way you don't get the one free update on the maps .
35                                                                                                                                                            I updated to the latest 2010 map soon after I received the unit, so the map is accurate to me .
36                                                                                                                                                                         I also like the way that it connects to the internet   to update all of its maps .
37                                                                                                  All I can really say about this, is update the Firm Ware straight out of the box, and when the GPS shows that it is acquiring signals   don't skip that .
38                                                                                                         I also like the fact that Garmin makes the most recent map updates available   rather than leave users hanging like some other GPS manufacturers .
39                                                                                                                                                                                                   Once you have the unit, you'll want to update the maps .
40                                                                                                                                                               Once receiving the unit, you get one map update download which must be used within 60 days .
41                                                                                                                       One guy posted on the forum that he had an older device and paid to update to the 2009 map 12 hours before the 2010 map was posted .
42                                                                                                                                                            Directions and maps are easy to use, and if you miss a turn, it updates your route in seconds .
43                                                                                                                                         I discovered that I need it while trying to register the device and or to get updated maps at the Garmin website .
44                                                                                                                                            More often than not, the estimated arrival time is updated 1, 2 minutes before the last expected arrival time .
45                                                                                                                                                                   Map update ,  when you register it on, line   you get an offer for one free map update .
46                                                                                                                                                  I plan to wait almost the full 60 days to get the latest update, then probably never purchase an update .
47                                                                                                                                                                                              By the time it needs a new update the unit will be obsolete .
48                                                                                                                                                                                          MapSource also makes it easy to update your unit's map annually .
49                                                                I have no need for the cell phone connection or traffic updates, just wanted a navigator to guide me from point A to point B as I get lost easily in my own town and to set up long trips .
50                                                                                                                  The only nitpick disappointment was when I downloaded the free 2010 map update it dosn't show road extensions completed a few years ago .
51                                                                                                                                                                                           Getting the prompted software update might have corrected that .
52                                                                                                                                                                                              easy to connect to garmin to download your free updated map .

54                                                                                                                ,  Updating the GPS took way to long and I have DSL ,  4 hours to download a 2GB map update and 3 hours to install the program to the GPS .
55                                                                                                                                                                                              I read that some Mac user could not get it to update at all .
56                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,  No traffic update but don't really need it

20                                                                                                                                                 As for the video camera it's a nice addition considering it's an mp3 player first and foremost, I think people are going to go into this and think maybe I can replace my old video, NO .
21                                                                                                                                                                  It just a solid low quality video camera some of the lighting or your fingers may get in the way of the actual recording but once you get use to it, it can become fun .
22                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I find it weird that it will take video but not still pics .
23                                                                                                                                                                                                           It looks just like the 4th generation, except on the back, there's a camera to take video clips or whatever it is you want to .
24                                                                                                                                 i hate itunes, but it seems to be a necessary evil in order to tag say a video as music and not a movie, so though i originally started with 3rd party apps for syncing i have since switched to itunes .
25                                                                                                                                                                            This time around, Apple is branching out of its iPod formula in a small, but not insignificant way by gracing the back of the Nano with its own video camera .

27                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     We have had portable video players for our children as our cars are not equipped with these devices .
28                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Video camera quality and sound are also surprising for such a small unit .
29                                                                                                                                                                             Not a tremendous surprise here, as we believed the sixth, generation  true video iPod  would not be announced until later in the year or even early in 2007 .

7                    The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .

10  First I want to address the  potential problem  on 255w which is the robotic sound, I personally think it is absolutely understandable, the female sound is a little vauge at some point, however the man's   voice is very clear to me, so this is not a problem for me .
11                                                                                     Some of the negatives that were mentioned that I did not find to be true were that you can't understand the voice   The possible list could go on and on but I think you get the idea .
12                                                                            The voice is somewhat robotic and some street names are mispronounced, but it's all understandable, I read comments in some reviews that the voice is not loud enough, but I have no problem   .

18                                                                                                                                                   At volumes of 60% or above, there is so much distortion that the voices sound like they are coming from a blown speaker .
19                                                                                                                                                                                  It seems to be caused by Garmin decreasing the file sizes and quality of the voice files .
20                                                                                                                                                                                                            On previous models like the 350 and 360 the voice files were 100
21                                                                                                                                                                                                       Its almost impossible to understand the voice as its metallic tinny .
22                                                                                                                                                                                  Many a times, this is a distraction as you will be wondering what the voice command said .
23                                                              Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .
24                                                                                                The most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .
25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And the voice and streets match perfectly .
26                                                                                                                                                                                                   the female voice   is much clearer than Jack, the male American English .
27                                                                                                                                              I couldn't understand the Australian or English voices, but Samantha is clear as a bell and can even be heard over the radio .
28                                                                                                                                                                                       The screen is easy to see, the voice tells you where you are and it's very accurate .
29                                                                                     When the voices are turned up loud enough for my satisfaction, the speakers sound like they are overpowered, making a distorted noise during the loudest parts of the system's voices .
30                                                                                                                                                                                           It seems that the female voices do not distort quite as much as the male voices .
31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The voices seem too robotic .
32                                                                                                                                                                                                      However, I much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .
33                                                                                                                                                                                                 Everybody said the same thing, great unit, but poor voice in the TTS mode .
34                                                                                                                                                                                                    So I called Garmin and ask if any fix was comming out to fix the voice .
35                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I bought the 255W and the voice was tinny and soft .
36                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Voice commands were mechanical but clear .
37                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I had no problem with the clarity of the voice system .
38                                                                                                                                                                                    A clear voice tells me when the turns are coming up, as well as the names of the roads .
39                                                                                                                                                                                                    the unit takes you on weird routes and people don't like the TTS voice .
40                                                                                                                                                       The user remarks on voice on saying the street name was important to me and easy use of device so too was important .
41                                                                                                                                                                                                      The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .
42                                                                                                                                                          The default voice is extremely clear and easy to understand, so I never even tried any of the alternative voices .
43                                                                                                     I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .
44                                                                                                                                     The voice instructions given are clear, but as few people mentioned in their reviews, you need to get familiar with the pronunciation .
45                                                                                                                                       Not only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .
46                                                                                                  This is a big help as I was essentially following that thick purple line while listening to the voice instructions to make sure I was make correct turns when in Buffalo .
47                                                                                                                     Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .
48                                                                                                                                                            I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .
49                                                                                                                                                                                                          I had read about concerns the voice prompts were not loud enough .
50                                                    I also love the small things, such as being able to download new voices, and vehicles, I plan on getting all the vehicles has on their site, because there is one for every season, for every mood, every time of year .
51                                                                                                                                                                                                          The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .
52                                                                                                                                                      There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .
53                                                                                                                                                                   I agree that the sound isn't great for the TTS voice but it's definitely audible and I like it over all .
54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The non TTS voice is more pleasant .
55                                                                                                                                                  The only complaint that I have if you even want to call it that is that the text, to, speech voices sound pretty robotic .

57                                                 The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .
58                                                                                                                                                   The unit worked well and I had no issue with the voice as I had my window up all the time and did not have the radio on .
59                                                                                                                                                                                                           I switched over to the male voice which I happen to like better .
60                                                    The screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .
61                                                                                                                          Under the Services link on the Garmin site look for the Goodies section and The Garmin Garage link for extra car images and sometimes voices too .
62                                                                                                                                                                   The only complaint I have is that the voice is a little bit tinny especially if the volume is turned up .
63                                                                                                                                                                   The voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .
64                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The voice is annoying as heck too, no personality .
65                                                                                                                                                                                                       The voice it has is clear and readable even for my 79 year old ears .
66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The voice is clear and easy to understand .
67                                                                                                              Since my near vision isn't very good I like the combination of the voice prompts and the big white arrow indicating an approaching turn, especially at night .
68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0 out of 5 stars No Jill voice on this one !
69                                                                                                                                                                      I rated this item with 4 stars because it does not have Jill's voice and there's no way to put it in .
70                                                                                                                                            All the english voices you have suck big time, you will not like not even one and the new Samantha voice really sucks big time .
71                                           What they did was, they made new voice files a lot smaller that on the previous models and all the new voices sound like crap and there's no way to copy the voices from other devices like you use to with the previous models .
72                                                                                                   If you input an address on where you want to go, it tells you how to get there in very clear graphics and also with a computer voice that is not obnoxious to listen to .
73                                         I'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .
74                                                                                                                                                                                                          Map is bright and detailed, voice directions are clear and loud  .
75                                                                                                                                                                                      The voice prompts  are mostly clear, sometimes quirky and the volume levels adequate .
76                                                                                                                                                                                                           The voice system gave ample time to make turns and lane changes .
77                                                                                                                                                                                                 Several voice options will announce both directions and street names, etc .
78                                                                                                                                                                                                                     From reviews, I thought there might only be one voice .
79                                                                                                                                                              The pre, installed english voice is a little robotic but if you switch to the british american it is perfect .
80                                                                                                                                                          After ample research   I selected the Nuvi 255W for it's abundant features, wider screen and voice communication .
81                                                                                                                                           VOICE ACTIVATION DID STOP WORKING & THEN CAME BACK IN GERMAN ,  JUST CHANGED IT BACK ENGLISH & HAS BEEN WORKING WELL SINCE THEN .
82                                                                                                                                                                                 Love that you can change the voice person talking on this one, my last one didn't do that .
83                                                                                                                                                                   Others have said that the voice directions leave something to be desired in terms of volume and clarity .
84                                                 I must say, though, that I believed it would have a certain cachet to use the British English female voice that is a standard feature but found that she could not properly pronounce some of the street names in my area .
85                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The voice commands are excellent and timely .
86                                                                                            The model 255W that we received seemed to take longer to find a satelite, and the man's voice was very fast and not as clear, and at times seemed a bit confused in directions .
87                                                                                                                                                                                     The voice is very clear and gives plenty of warning when we need to make a turn ahead ."
